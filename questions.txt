Methotrexate MOA à dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor
Methotrexate side-effects à pulmonary fibrosis + hepatotoxicity + mouth ulcers (neutropenia)
Sulfasalazine MOA à metabolized into sulfapyridine + mesalamine in the gut by bacteria
Mesalamine is 5-ASA absorbed as the Tx for RA; only NSAID considered to be DMARD
Leflunomide MOA à dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor (pyrimidine synthesis)
Most specific Abs in RA à anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide), not RF (rheumatoid factor)
X-ray of hands in RA vs OA à Only OA has DIPs involved; RA is PIPs + MCPs
Symmetry in RA vs OA à RA is symmetrical; OA is not
Any pt with red, warm, tender knee à joint aspiration (arthrocentesis); septic arthritis till proven otherwise
Biggest risk factor for septic arthritis à abnormal joint architecture
Pt groups most likely to get SA à prosthetic joints, RA/OA, recent intense exercise/joint trauma; peds (JRA)

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 17

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
Pt group most likely to get SA à those with prosthetic joints (can’t be more abnormal than fake joint)

Woman 30s-40s with random bruising at different stages of healing à (also ITP; first rule out abuse)
Mechanism of ITP à Abs against GpIIb/IIIa on platelets
Dx of ITP à answer = low platelet count; don’t choose increased bleeding time
ITP Tx à steroids first, then IVIG, then splenectomy

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 18

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
ITP episode à next best step in management à steroids
ITP episode à most effective way to decrease recurrence à splenectomy (not first-line, but most effective)

HY USMLE Review – Part II
-

“Hot feels cold; cold feels hot” (temperature dysesthesia) à ciguatera toxicity à toxin blocks sodium
channels à caused by consumption of reef fish (mahimahi, Spanish mackerel, etc.)

-

Pt with no prior Hx of atopy/asthma + eats meaty fish in sketch location (e.g., Bali) + develops
dyspnea + allergic-like reaction à answer = scombroid, not seafood allergy à histidine decarboxylase
in decaying fish convert histidine to histamine à allergic-like reaction (often misdiagnosed as allergy)

-

Pt gets allergic-like reaction after eating shellfish à answer = shellfish allergy, not scombroid
(students get all trigger-happy about scombroid after learning about something new, weird, and cool,
but if on the USMLE they say shellfish, it’s shellfish allergy, not scombroid)

-

Vomiting a few hours after eating meat à S. aureus preformed heat-stable toxin

-

Vomiting (or any unusual Sx like bloody diarrhea) + eating custards, creams, potato salad à answer =
S. aureus preformed HS toxin à the type of food in this scenario “wins” over the weird bloody
diarrhea finding à bear in mind typical bloody-diarrhea-inducing gram (-) rods like EHEC, Yersinia
enterocolitica, Campylobacter, Shigella, Salmonella have ~1-3-day incubation period) à iow, if you
get sick on the scale of hours from food, S. aureus preformed toxin is likely

-

Tx of otitis externa à topical ciprofloxacin + hydrocortisone drops

-

Prophylaxis for otitis externa (i.e., in someone with continued water exposure, like crew) à topical
alcohol-acetic acid drops

-

Tx for cerumen buildup à carbamide peroxide drops

-

Most common cause of otitis externa à Pseudomonas

-

Otitis externa + mastoiditis à malignant otitis externa

-

Mx of malignant otitis externa à CT or MRI of temporal bone because pus collection is common; if
don’t rule out fluid collection and drain it appropriately, can cause brain abscess; this is on one of the
pediatric NBME forms, where the answer was CT of the temporal bone in a two-year-old, which is an
outrageous dose of radiation for a kid, but it’s the answer on the form; in UW for 2CK, they didn’t list
CT, but had MRI and x-ray as answers, and MRI was correct; apparently x-ray is insufficient;
mastoiditis will classically present in kid with a pinna that’s displaced upward and outward, often with
him or her pulling on it bc of the pain.

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

3

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

Tx of otitis media à amoxicillin (amoxicillin/clavulanate [Augmentin] is the wrong answer initially;
use Augmentin for recurrent OM)

-

When to do a tympanostomy tube? à 3+ OM in a 6-month period or 4+ in a year

-

Tx for Strep pharyngitis? à Amoxicillin or penicillin only (not Augmentin)

-

Aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary abscess; which antibiotic should be given? à clindamycin
(anaerobes above the diaphragm)

-

Cups and cups of foul-smelling sputum in COPD, TB, or CF patient à bronchiectasis

-

Most common cause of bronchiectasis à worldwide: TB; in western countries: CF

-

Young kid + scant white sputum + linear opacity in right-middle lobe on CXR; Dx? à answer =
bronchiectasis caused by right middle lobe syndrome (no I am not fucking with you; this is on one of
the pediatric 2CK forms à 1st question I’ve ever seen of bronchiectasis where it wasn’t cups and cups
of foul-smelling sputum; also, if you Google, it, there literally is a peds condition called right middle
lobe syndrome that leads to bronchiectasis à search it over some tacos and a Samuel Adams and
knock yourself out)

-

Chromosome for AR and AD polycystic kidney disease à 6 for AR; 16 for AD

-

ADPKD à which do we do for screening, MR angiogram circle of Willis, or serial blood pressure
checks? à answer = serial blood pressure checks à don’t do MR angiogram screening unless FHx of
aneurysm à most patients get high blood pressure from cyst impingement on renal microvasculature
à RAAS surges

-

Most common extra-renal location for cysts à liver

-

Important point about AR: shows up in peds + causes hepatic fibrosis

-

Important point about AD: presents in adults; cysts present from birth but just grow + become
symptomatic ages 30-40+.

-

Empiric Abx therapy for meningitis à ceftriaxone + vancomycin (+/- steroids)

-

Lumbar puncture or Abx first in suspected meningitis? à new guidelines say LP first

-

When do you do CT head before LP in suspected meningitis?
o

Confusion that interferes with neurologic exam / decreased GCS score

o

Seizure

o

Focal neurologic signs (motor or sensory)

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

4

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
o

Papilledema or if the optic fundi cannot be visualized

o

Above reasons indicate potential mass lesion, where if you do an LP you can cause tonsillar
herniation and death; if CT negative, proceed cautiously to LP

-

Bacterial meningitis: low glucose, high protein, high neutrophils (polymorphonuclear cells; PMNs)

-

Aseptic (viral) meningitis: normal glucose, normal (or slightly elevated) protein, high lymphocytes

-

Fungal meningitis: low glucose, high protein, high lymphocytes (similar to bacterial, but high
lymphocytes instead of neutrophils)

-

Herpes encephalitis: lots of RBCs in CSF due to temporal lobe hemorrhage à CT is often negative,
but sometimes Q will mention wave slowing or temporal complexes on EEG

-

Difference between meningitis and encephalitis à meningitis is nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness) +
photophobia + ophthalmoplegia; encephalitis presents with confusion

-

Dx of Cryptococcal meningitis? à answer = latex agglutination if it’s listed over India ink;
mucicarmine staining (red stain) can also be done

-

Tx for Cryptococcal meningitis à amphotericin B + flucytosine, followed by fluconazole taper

-

Nodular density in upper lobe in immunocompromised pt à aspergilloma à next best step = open
lung biopsy (sounds radical, but it’s the answer on one of the NBME forms) à Tx with -azole à
invasive aspergillosis can be treated with caspofungin or voriconazole

-

22M + Hx of three bacterial pneumonias + atopy; presents today with a sore left cheek; Dx? à IgA
deficiency (student says “wtf?”) à firstly, sore cheek is sinusitis à IgA deficiency is recurrent
sinopulmonary infections that “aren’t that bad” in a patient “not that young” (that is, it’s not a supersick three-year-old like in SCID or Bruton) à can present with autoimmune phenomena like atopy
and vitiligo); also can present with Hx of Giardia à apparently Step 1 is also now testing that IgA
deficiency means in the Dx of Celiac disease can’t do IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase reliably bc
clearly the pt wouldn’t make the IgA à anaphylaxis after blood transfusion is super HY for IgA
deficiency, but also too easy and not mentioned in most Qs.

-

Most common immunodeficiency in humans à IgA deficiency

-

17F + 1-year Hx of autoimmune thyroiditis + 2-year Hx of type I DM + Candidal infections since
childhood; Dx? à chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis à two points: 1) clearly the Candidal infections
can’t be due to the diabetes if she’s had them since childhood and only DM for two years; 2) USMLE

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

5

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
likes “autoimmune conditions go together,” the same way it likes “autoimmune conditions and
immunodeficiencies go together”; in other words, CMC and IgA deficiency are examples of
immunodeficiencies with an autoimmune origin, so the vignette mentioning autoimmune
phenomenon isn’t an accident.
-

Dx of PJPneumonia à bronchoalveolar lavage

-

When to add steroids to TMP/SMX for PJP? à A-a gradient >35 or pO2 <60 mm Hg

-

36M + long-bone fractures + petechiae on the chest à fat embolism

-

Motor vehicle accident (MVA) + paradoxical breathing (chest moves outward with exhalation; inward
with inhalation) à flail chest

-

MVA + rib fractures + underlying infiltrates in lung + low O2 sats à pulmonary contusion

-

MVA + no rib fractures + non-central chest pain + pulmonary infiltrates underlying the painful area à
pulmonary contusion (resources will say “white out of the lung” for pulmonary contusion, but this is
buzzywordy and never shows up on actual NBME material)

-

MVA + pulmonary infiltrates + low O2 sats + bolus of normal saline given, resulting in worsening of O2
sats à pulmonary contusion (contused lung is very sensitive to fluid overload)

-

MVA + bruising/pain over the sternum +/- rib fractures à myocardial contusion

-

MVA + bruising/pain over sternum + pulmonary infiltrates + O2 sats get worse when saline is given à
answer = myocardial contusion (“Wait, but I thought you said that latter finding means pulmonary
contusion” à it does, and it’s HY for pulmonary contusion, but “bruising/pain over the sternum” wins
if it’s listed; this is on a 2CK NBME)

-

Important point about Mx of myocardial contusion à do troponins + must monitor for arrhythmia

-

Adult male + abdo pain + Hx of alcohol use + diffuse pulmonary infiltrates + low O2 sats à ARDS

-

ARDS must have pO2/FiO2 <300

-

Tx of ARDS à low-tidal volume mechanical ventilation (prevents barotrauma) + increase PEEP

-

When you get a random ventilator Q and they want an answer à “increase PEEP” almost always right

-

Patient has improving O2 sats on ventilator; next best step? à “wean from ventilator”

-

Thyroid dysfunction on ventilator à euthyroid sick syndrome à normal TSH, normal T4, low T3, high
reverse T3 (cortisol decreases peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, allowing more to go to reverse T3)

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

6

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

Wtf is reverse T3? à an inactive form of T3; all you need to know is that if T4 goes up (e.g., in
Graves), reverse T3 should be up because T4 will convert to both T3 and reverse T3; it is also elevated
in euthyroid sick syndrome (and T3 down!)

-

25F + intermittent bloody diarrhea for 3 months + intermittent fever + weight loss à answer IBD
(Crohn or UC)

-

Tx for Crohn + UC à USMLE wants oral sulfasalazine (or mesalamine) first before oral steroids; for
perianal disease in Crohn, topical agents / enemas can be used; NBME won’t make you pick between
oral and topical distinguish (that’s more Qbank being pedantic); surgery can be done for UC

-

UC + high bilirubin + high ALP à primary sclerosing cholangitis

-

Red shins + Crohn à erythema nodosum (type III hypersensitivity; panniculitis à inflammation of
subcutaneous fat, not a rash)

-

Crater with necrotic debris on forearm + UC à pyoderma gangrenosum

-

IBD + eczematoid plaque on forehead + sore joints à psoriatic arthritis (HLA-B27 à PAIR à Psoriasis,
Ankylosing spondylitis, IBD, Reactive arthritis)

-

IBD + back pain à sacroiliitis (or ankylosing spondylitis)

-

Biopsy in Crohn à non-caseating granulomas; transmural; UC you don’t see these findings

-

Vesicles anywhere on body (not limited for extensors) + Celiac à dermatitis herpetiformis

-

Biopsy of DH à IgA deposition at dermal papillae

-

Biopsy of small bowel in Celiac à flattening of intestinal villi

-

Dx of Celiac à IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase, anti-gliadin (aka anti-endomysial)

-

After Celiac Ab positivity, what’s the next best step (no further intervention necessary or duodenal
biopsy) à answer = duodenal biopsy (sounds wrong, but it’s what USMLE wants)

-

Weird factoid about Celiac à increased risk of T cell lymphoma

-

Biopsy of small bowel in lactose intolerance à normal villi

-

Dx of lactose intolerance à hydrogen breath test or decreased stool pH

-

Vague vignette where it sounds like either Celiac or lactose intolerance but it’s in a young adult who’s
had zero symptoms until now à lactose intolerance (can be adult-onset)

-

PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria + arthritis à Whipple disease

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

7

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

AIDS patient with CD4 count of 47 + confluent ulcers seen on colonoscopy à CMV colitis à confluent
means “linear” à CMV = linear ulcers; HSV = punched-out ulcers

-

Tx for CMV à ganciclovir (DNA polymerase inhibitor)

-

Toxicity of ganciclovir à neutropenia (mouth ulcers + fever)

-

Tx of herpes à acyclovir

-

Toxicity of acyclovir à nephrotoxicity (crystal nephropathy à acyclovir stones not visible on CT)

-

Hereditary angioedema à due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency

-

Tx for HA à danazol (synthetic androgen receptor partial agonist that causes liver to make more
C1EI)

-

Don’t give which drugs to patients with HA à ACEi (can cause angioedema)

-

Familial thyroid cancer à medullary (even if they mention nothing else related to MEN 2A/2B); applegreen birefringence on Congo red stain due to amyloid deposition; serum calcitonin high

-

Calcitonin mechanism of action à inhibits osteoclast activity (not the opposite of PTH; in other
words, doesn’t put calcium back into bone; it merely caps the Ca that can resorb out of the bone)

-

Most common thyroid cancer à papillary; extends lymphatogenously; has papillary structure and
psammoma bodies on LM; don’t worry about buzzywordy things like Orphan Annie nuclei

-

Follicular carcinoma à literally just thyroid follicles on biopsy; will be a cold nodule, like any other
type of thyroid cancer (for instance, if you see follicles but it’s a hot nodule w/ increased uptake,
that’s a toxic adenoma, rather than follicular thyroid cancer); spreads hematogenously

-

Hashimoto + thyroid cancer + no other histo description à thyroid lymphoma à autoimmune
diseases increase the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma

-

MEN1 à pituitary, pancreas, parathyroid (MEN1 gene; chromosome 11)

-

MEN2A à parathyroid, medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma

-

MEN2B à medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas, Marfanoid body
habitus (“oid” means looks like but ain’t)

-

Riedel thyroiditis à fibrosis of thyroid à can extend into adjacent structures, e.g., the esophagus,
and resemble anaplastic carcinoma

-

52M + abdominal mass + weight loss + biopsy shows lymphocytes + interspersed macrophages à
Burkitt lymphoma (student says: “Wtf? I thought Burkitt was the African boy with a jaw lesion.” Yeah,

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

8

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
but in Western countries, Burkitt is usually intra-abdominal; even new studies in Africa have shown a
growing preponderance of intra-abdominal Burkitt)
-

Translocation for Burkitt à t(8;14), but USMLE also wants you to know t(2;8) and t(8;22)

-

Gene for Burkitt à c-myc à transcription factor

-

Translocation for CML à t(9;22) à Philadelphia chromosome

-

What is the product of the t(9;22) à bcr/abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor

-

Tx for CML à imatinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)

-

Side-effect of imatinib à fluid retention (edema)

-

What do you see on bloods in CML à high leukocyte count (mature neutrophils + metamyelocytes +
myelocytes)

-

Translocation for APL (AML M3) à t(15;17)

-

What do you see on blood smear in APL à Auer rods

-

What are Auer rods composed of? à myeloperoxidase (cause DIC when released into blood during
Tx)

-

Translocation for follicular lymphoma à t(14;18)

-

Gene for follicular lymphoma à bcl-2 à anti-apoptotic molecule

-

Most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma à follicular (waxing and waning neck mass over two
years in an adult)

-

Most common aggressive NHL à diffuse-large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)

-

Translocation for mantle cell lymphoma à t(11;14)

-

17F + painless lateral neck mass + mediastinal mass; Dx? à Hodgkin lymphoma

-

42M + painless lateral neck mass + hepatomegaly; Dx? à Hodgkin lymphoma

-

40M + Hodgkin lymphoma + renal condition à minimal change disease (“Wtf? Isn’t that kids after
viral infection?” à It’s also seen in Hodgkin due to a cytokine effect for whatever magical reason; in
UW for 2CK actually)

-

Biopsy of lymph node in Hodgkin à Reed-Sternberg cells (“owl eyes” à CD15/30+ B cells)

-

Are lymphomas / leukemias normally B or T cell? à almost always B cell

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

9

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

When is the answer T cell? à When pt has a thymic lesion as evidenced by a positive Pemberton sign
(flushing of face with arms above the head) à mediastinal mass in Hodgkin is due to mediastinal
lymph node enlargement, not a thymic mass (thymic lesion in Hodgkin exceedingly rare)

-

When to give a statin on the USMLE? à Guidelines from 2019 ACC/AHA à First you need to know
important CVD risk factors: (LDL > 100 mg/dL; hypertension, smoking Hx, CKD, albuminuria, FHx of
CVD in first degree relative [sibling or parent]
o

Anyone age 20-39 with an LDL > 190 mg/dL

o

Anyone age 40-75 with an LDL > 70 mg/dL

o

Age >75 à assessment of risk status + clinician-patient discussion are recommended before
commencing or discontinuing a statin

o

Diabetics <40 if one or more above bold risk factor(s) present

o

Anyone age <19 with familial hypercholesterolemia

o

Balance of risk factors contributes to an ASCVD risk score that determines intensity of statin
administered to the patient (not assessed on USMLE); what the USMLE cares about is you
knowing whether or not to give a statin period.

-

First drug to start in T2DM à metformin

-

Side-effect of metformin à lactic acidosis

-

Mechanism of metformin à “increases glycolysis; decreases gluconeogenesis”

-

Tx of impetigo à topical mupirocin

-

Tx of erysipelas + cellulitis à oral dicloxacillin or oral cephalexin

-

Inpatient Tx of MSSA à IV flucloxacillin or IV cephazolin

-

Tx of osteomyelitis à IV nafcillin or IV oxacacilin or IV cephazolin; add ceftriaxone in sickle cell; add
clindamycin in MRSA

-

Tx of MRSA skin infection à clindamycin, or TMP/SMX, or doxycycline, or linezolid à vanc has poor
skin penetration

-

Suspected incarcerated hernia in a vignette à answer = immediate groin exploration

-

Most common cause of fever after surgery à atelectasis

-

Electrolyte abnormality in Cushing syndrome à hypokalemia (chronically high glucocorticoid can
cause potassium wasting distally in the kidney similar to aldosterone)

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 10

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

Pt has tachy + diaphoresis + diarrhea after drug à serotonin syndrome (tramadol; MOA too soon
after stopping SSRI)

-

Pt has tachy + diaphoresis + diarrhea + tricuspid valve lesion à carcinoid syndrome

-

Cause of carcinoid syndrome à usually small bowel or appendiceal tumor that has metastasized to
liver (if not metastasized, liver can process serotonin derivatives it receives); can also be due to
bronchogenic carcinoid; tumors are S-100 positive and of neural crest origin

-

Dx of serotonin + carcinoid syndromes à urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA)

-

Tx of serotonin syndrome à remove offending agents + administer cyproheptadine (serotonin
receptor antagonist)

-

Tx of carcinoid syndrome à Tx underlying condition

-

Asthma (outpatient) à albuterol (short-acting beta-2 agonist; SABA) inhaler for immediate Mx à if
insufficient, start low-dose ICS (inhaled corticosteroid) preventer à if insufficient, maximize dose of
ICS preventer à if insufficient, add salmeterol inhaler (long-acting beta-2 agonist; LABA); in other
words:

-

1) SABA; then

-

2) low-dose ICS; then

-

3) maximize dose ICS; then

-

4) LABA.

-

That initial order is universal. Then you need to know last resort is oral corticosteroids, however they
are most effective. In other words:

-

12M has ongoing wheezing episodes + is on albuterol inhaler; next best step? à add low-dose ICS

-

12M has ongoing wheezing episodes + is on albuterol inhaler; what’s most likely to decrease
recurrence à oral corticosteroids (student says “wtf? I thought you said ICS was what we do next and
that oral steroids are last resort” Yeah, you’re right, but they’re still most effective at decreasing
recurrence. This isn’t something I’m romanticizing; this distinction is assessed on the FM NBME forms.

-

After the LABA and before the oral steroids, any number of agents can be given in any order – i.e.,
nedocromil or cromolyn sodium, zileuton, montelukast, zafirlukast.

-

MOA of nedocromil and cromolyn sodium à mast cell stabilizers

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 11

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

MOA of zileuton à lipoxygenase inhibitor (enzyme that makes leukotrienes from arachidonic acid)

-

MOA of the -lukasts à leukotriene LTC, D, and E4 inhibitors. LTB4 receptor agonism is unrelated and
induces neutrophilic chemotaxis (LTB4, IL-8, kallikrein, platelet-activating factor, C5a, bacterial
proteins)

-

16M goes snowboarding all day + takes pain reliever for sore muscles afterward + next day develops
wheezing out on the slopes again; what’s going on? à took aspirin + this is Samter triad (now
cumbersomely known as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [AERD]) à triad of aspirin-induced
asthma + aspirin hypersensitivity + nasal polyps). Just to be clear, other NSAIDs can precipitate
Samter triad, but the literature + USMLE will make it explicitly about aspirin.

-

16M takes aspirin + gets wheezing; what are we likely to see on physical exam? à answer on USMLE
= nasal polyps.

-

“Wait I don’t understand. Why would aspirin cause asthma?” à arachidonic acid can be shunted
down either the cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase pathways; if you knock out COX irreversibly by giving
aspirin (or reversibly with another NSAID), more arachidonic acid will be shunted down the
lipoxygenase pathway à more leukotrienes à more bronchoconstriction

-

Kid has Hx of AERD; physician considers agent to decrease his recurrence of Sx à zileuton, or -lukasts
(both are correct; and only one will be listed).

-

Kid has Hx of AERD; what agent is most likely to decrease his recurrence of Sx à oral steroids (sounds
wrong, but once again, you need to know oral steroids are most effective for preventing asthma,
period; this is exceedingly HY, especially on family medicine forms). We simply don’t want to give
them because of their nasty side-effects (Cushing syndrome).

-

Any weird asthma Txs? à omalizumab à monoclonal antibody against IgE à used for intractable,
severe asthma unresponsive to oral steroids + in patients who have eosinophilia + high IgE levels (I
asked a pulmonologist about this drug years ago when I was in MS3 and he said he was managing
1000 patients with asthma and just three were on omalizumab).

-

Acute asthma Mx (emergencies) à most important piece of info straight-up is: USMLE wants you to
know that inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have no role in acute asthma management. First thing we do
is give oxygen (any USMLE Q that shows depressed O2 sats, answer is always O2) + nebulized

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 12

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
albuterol (face mask with mist); IV steroids are then administered. The Mx algorithm is more
complicated, but that is what you need for the USMLE.
-

Acid-base disturbance in asthma? à respiratory alkalosis à low O2, low CO2, high pH, normal bicarb

-

“Wait, why the low CO2? Aren’t you not able to breathe?” à low CO2 is due to high respiratory rate;
even if your bronchioles are constricted + filled with secretions, CO2 can diffuse really quickly; in
contrast, O2 diffuses slowly and requires healthy airways; that’s why with a high RR, O2 and CO2 are
both low (O2 can’t get in, but CO2 can still get out); 19 times out of 20 on the USMLE, if your
respiratory rate is high, CO2 is low.

-

“19 times out of 20? Then what’s the exception.” à I’ve seen COPD questions where the patient will
have a RR of 28 but a super-high CO2, and the answer is chronic respiratory acidosis + acute
respiratory acidosis (acute on chronic) à in the event of emphysema, where you literally have
reduced surface area for gas exchange, even if your RR is high, CO2 has no way of diffusing out.

-

“Wait, why is bicarb normal in acute asthma attack? Shouldn’t it go low to compensate if CO2 is low?”
à not enough time for bicarb to change; takes a minimum of 12-24 hours for renal elimination to
have an effect on serum levels; this is why in altitude sickness, where CO2 is low (due to high RR bc of
lower atmospheric O2), azetazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) can be given to increase bicarb
loss in the PCT of the kidney to essentially force a metabolic acidosis to compensate.

-

12M + acute asthma episode + given O2 + nebulized albuterol + IV steroids + his acid-base
disturbance is as we talked about above à after 30 minutes, new values are: low O2, normal CO2,
normal pH, normal bicarb; why? à he’s getting tired à low O2 means he should still be
hyperventilating, so for CO2 and pH to have normalized means his RR is decreasing à answer on
USMLE = intubate. When O2 and CO2 are both initially down, that’s called a type I respiratory failure;
then eventually it will invert, where this patient will have a respiratory acidosis with low O2, high CO2,
low pH, normal bicarb (type II respiratory failure when O2 and CO2 are the opposite).

-

Acid-base disturbance in pulmonary embolism? à same as acute asthma: low O2, low CO2, high pH,
normal bicarb.

-

Tx of pulmonary embolism à heparin before spiral CT; do V/Q scan in pregnant women.

-

In pregnant women, if V/Q scan shows segmental defect; what’s the next best step in Dx? à answer
= spiral CT à “Wait, but I thought we don’t do CT in pregnant women.” You’re right. We don’t. But if

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 13

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
for whatever magical reason they ask you what the next best step in Dx is after the V/Q scan is
positive, the answer is CT. It doesn’t mean we’re going to do it. But it’s the answer. And this is in UW
for 2CK.
-

Pt has PE and is already on warfarin à answer = don’t give heparin; go straight to spiral CT.

-

What about IVC filter? à After the spiral CT confirms the PE, an IVC filter can be inserted in a patient
who’s already anticoagulated. The tricky part is, don’t select IVC filter before doing the CT to
confirm. Students will memorize IVC filter as the answer in someone who’s already on warfarin, but
think about it: you’re not going to stick a fucking filter in someone’s IVC before at least confirming the
PE with the spiral CT.

-

What about tPA in PE? à Never an answer on the USMLE because the indications are debated.

-

Is tPA ever an answer for anything? à Ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours. Must do non-contrast CT of
the head to confirm no bleed before giving tPA.

-

72M has 30 minutes of facial drooping + arm weakness since waking up from a nap à amount of time
since stroke = amount of time that has passed since he was last known to be normal (i.e., before he
went to sleep) à on the USMLE, this situation often means don’t give the tPA.

-

Regarding contraindications for tPA on the USMLE: most important one is BP, which is 185/110 (if
either value is exceeded, don’t give tPA). There are many contraindications, but other HY ones are
low platelets, high PT or aPTT; Hx of GI bleed past 21 days; Hx of intracranial bleed; recent major
surgery.

-

45F + alcoholic + increased creatine kinase à rhabdomyolysis (increased risk in alcoholics)

-

82F + fell in her house + positive for blood on urine dipstick + negative for RBCs on urine LM à
rhabdomyolysis (myoglobinuria causes false-positive blood on dipstick)

-

Anemia in alcoholism? à non-megaloblastic macrocytic anemia (USMLE will give you high MCV
[normal is 80-100] in alcoholic with a bunch of other things going on, and they merely want you to
know his high MCV is due to the alcohol)

-

Electrolyte abnormality in rhabdo à hyperkalemia (cell lysis + renal failure à myoglobin causes acute
tubular necrosis)

-

Woman has episiotomy posterior in the midline (vaginal incision made to allow for fetus’s head to
pass through birth canal without causing vaginal laceration); if the doctor cuts too far, what will he
cut into? à answer = external anal sphincter

-

Stress incontinence à weakened pelvic floor muscles resulting in loss of urine with increased
abdominal pressure (coughing, sneezing, laughing) à Hx of multiple pregnancies classic, but often
too easy of a descriptor and they won’t say that à they’ll say there’s “downward movement of the
vesicourethral junction with coughing”; next best step in Mx? à pelvic floor (Kegel) exercises à if
insufficient, do mid-urethral sling; do not give medications for stress incontinence (HY!).

-

USMLE might ask you which muscle is not strengthened by Kegel exercises à student then proceeds
to have two thoughts: 1) “wtf, I’m supposed to know Kegel exercises at that high level of detail?” and
2) couldn’t any muscle not be strengthened by Kegel exercises; I mean, the deltoid wouldn’t be for
instance.” à answer to this Q = internal anal sphincter à even if you have zero clue about Kegel
exercises, bear in mind internal sphincters (urethral + anal) are under sympathetic control à you
can’t voluntarily strengthen a muscle not under somatic (voluntary) control; in case you’re curious
though, Kegel strengthens levator ani (which comprises pubococcygeus, puborectalis, and
iliococcygeus).

-

Urge incontinence à answer = “hyperactive detrusor,” or “detrusor instability” à needs to run to the
bathroom when sticking a key in the front door; needs to run to bathroom when opening car door;
answer in multiple sclerosis + menopause (part of vasomotor Sx); can be idiopathic; answer = give
oxybutynin (anti-muscarinic) or mirabegron (beta-3 agonist); once again, do not give these drugs in
stress incontinence.

-

Overflow incontinence à answer in diabetes and BPH à neurogenic bladder caused by myelin
damage from sorbitol (glucose enters myelin, causing osmotic damage); in BPH, merely due to outlet
obstruction à leads to detrusor burnout; in overflow incontinence, postvoid volume is high (i.e.,
300-400 mL in USMLE Qs); normal should be <50-75 mL; for diabetic bladder, answer = bethanecol
(muscarinic agonist); for BPH, insert catheter first always.

-

82M + dribbling, hesitancy, interruption of urinary stream + suprapubic mass (bladder) + bacteria in
the urine à answer = insert catheter first, not antibiotics

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 15

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

25F + 6 weeks of dysuria + anterior vaginal wall pain + urinary findings normal à answer = chronic
interstitial cystitis; must have 6+ weeks of Sx in the absence of any findings; anterior vaginal wall pain
sounds weird, but it’s on the obgyn NBME forms, and something to bear in mind is that a cystocele
(unrelated) will protrude through the anterior superior vaginal wall, so the anatomic proximity is
known to cause symptomatology.

-

Detrusor muscle à contracts under parasympathetic activity via the pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2-S4);
when not voiding, detrusor muscle is kept relaxed by sympathetic activity via the inferior hypogastric
nerves (T10-L1).

-

Internal urethral sphincter à kept closed by sympathetic activity via inferior hypogastric nerves (T10L1).

-

External urethral sphincter à Opened by somatic activity via the pudendal nerve (S2-4)

-

40M goes hiking + linear vesicles on calf appearing days later à answer = contact dermatitis = type IV
hypersensitivity; linear vesicles = poison ivy/sumac

-

38F gardens a lot + gets rash on face, arms, backs of hands à answer = contact dermatitis from
sunscreen

-

Type I HS à fast-onset; anaphylaxis; atopy (asthma, hay fever [rhinoconjunctivitis], eczema); two
IgEs bind antigen at Fab fragments + move into close proximity and crosslink à mast cell
degranulates + secretes histamine; answer for drug rashes that occur soon after receiving the drug
(e.g., sulfa); treat anaphylaxis with IM epinephrine (beta 2 agonism opens the lungs; NE doesn’t act
on beta 2)

-

Type II HS à autoantibodies against one’s own cells + receptors
o

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT; Abs against platelet factor 4-heparin complex) à
treat by stopping heparin + giving direct-thrombin inhibitor (i.e., dabigatran or lepirudin);
warfarin is the wrong answer

o

Graves disease à activating TSH Abs against TSH receptor

o

Goodpasture syndrome à “2, 3, 4… 2, 3, 4… 2, 3, 4. The Goodpasture is marching in the
field, 2, 3, 4!”à Type 2 hypersensitivity against the alpha-3 chains of type 4 collagen

o

Pernicious anemia à Abs against intrinsic factor or parietal cells à decreased B12
absorption through terminal ileum

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 16

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
o

Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia à Coomb positive, meaning IgG targets RBCs à seen
in things like ABO mismatch, drugs/infection; CLL

o

Cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia à IgM Abs against RBCs à classically Mycoplasma

o

ITP (immune thrombocytopenia purpura) à Abs against GpIIb/IIIa on platelets à low
platelet count + high bleeding time à treat with steroids, then IVIG, then splenectomy

-

Type III HS à Ab-Ag complexes
o

Serum sickness à immune complexes depositing in joints several days after drug or
infection

o

Arthus reaction à localized cutaneous type III HS à skin reaction/rash at injection site
several days after administration of agent à key point is that it’s not immediate; in type I
hypersensitivity, we’d get an immediate reaction; in Arthus reaction, it takes a few days

o

Super HY is postinfectious arthritis à arthritis due to HepB, HepC, rubella, Yersinia
enterocolitica, etc. à immune complex deposition in joints à this is considered a serum
sickness

o

Erythema nodosum à panniculitis (inflammation of subcutaneous fat) due to immune
complex deposition à USMLE likes Crohn disease, sulfa drugs, Strep infections, and
Coccidioidomycosis as causes.

o

Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) à can occur after skin infections as well (i.e.,
impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis)

-

-

Type IV hypersensitivity à T cell-mediated response (delayed)
o

Contact dermatitis (nickel [wristwatches], sunscreen, poison ivy/sumac, rubber

o

PPD test for TB

o

Multiple sclerosis (T cell attack against oligodendrocytes in white matter)

o

Stevens-Johnson syndrome; toxic epidermal necrolysis

Need to know low bicarb in pt with dehydration (or any type of shock) à answer = lactic acidosis à
decreased perfusion to vital organs à decreased oxygen delivery à increased anaerobic respiration
à increased lactic acid

-

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

Tx for ethylene glycol and methanol toxicity à fomepizole only if listed à in other words, if you get
combinations with “ethanol first then fomepizole,” etc., just choose “fomepizole only” if it’s listed

-

Paint thinner + blurry vision à methanol toxicity (on one of the later Step 1 NBMEs)

-

Which decreases risk of stroke more, smoking cessation or BP control? à BP control (USMLE wants
lisinopril as the answer, not smoking cessation); for stroke, answer is always hypertension as worse
risk factor

-

High HbA2 à answer = beta-thalassemia

-

Dx of alpha or beta thalassemia à hemoglobin electrophoresis

-

Pregnant woman has low serum iron that doesn’t improve with iron supplementation à answer = do
hemoglobin electrophoresis à Dx = thalassemia (usually alpha trait with one mutation because that’s
asymptomatic)

-

Dx of sickle cell à hemoglobin electrophoresis

-

Dx of multiple myeloma à serum protein electrophoresis, then bone marrow biopsy

-

Adult male + works in manufacturing/factory + cognitive decline + microcytic anemia à answer = lead
poisoning à inhibits delta-ALA dehydratase + ferrochelatase à microcytic anemia is really HY for
lead poisoning à will often see basophilic stippling or RBCs

-

What kind of RBCs in thalassemia à target cells

-

Infection + RBCs lacking central pallor + positive Coomb test à answer = hemolytic anemia, not
hereditary spherocytosis à spherocytes are seen in drug- and infection-induced hemolytic anemia,
not just in HS à difference is Coomb (IgG against RBCs) is positive in Ab-induced hemolytic anemia,
but clearly not in HS bc the latter is cytoskeletal (ankyrin, spectrin, band protein deficiency) in
etiology.

-

12M + red urine 1-3 days after upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) à IgA nephropathy, not PSGN;
can also get IgA nephropathy from GI infections

infections

-

6F + red urine + abdo pain + arthralgias + violaceous lesions on buttocks + thighs; Dx? à HenochSchonlein purpura; red urine = IgA nephropathy à HSP is tetrad of 1) IgA nephropathy, 2) palpable
purpura, 3) arthralgias, 4) abdo pain

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

23F + unilateral resting tremor + hemolytic anemia + increased LFTs; next best step in Mx? à answer
= do a slit-lamp exam à Dx = Wilson disease; Parkinsonism in a young patient = Wilson disease until
proven otherwise à low serum ceruloplasmin + increased urinary copper

-

Tx for Wilson disease à penicillamine

-

Tx for hereditary hemochromatosis à serial phlebotomy

-

Tx for secondary hemochromatosis (transfusional siderosis) due to chronic blood transfusions à
chelation therapy

-

Pink line tracking up the arm from the palm in 35M who burned himself recently; Dx? à lymphangitis
à sporotrichosis is wrong answer (can cause lymphatogenous spread)

-

Brown recluse spider bite à abdominal pain; manage symptomatically

-

Black widow spider bite à causes hypocalcemia à give IV calcium gluconate

-

Woman who works in dental care with vesicle on finger; Dx? à herpetic whitlow à HSV1/2 of the
finger à treat with oral acyclovir (in real life will give both oral and topical; on the USMLE, answer is
always oral)

-

Suspected skin cancer in non-cosmetically sensitive area à surgical excision

-

Suspected skin cancer on face à Mohs surgery (thin slices looking for positive margins)

-

Suspected skin cancer on neck à full-thickness biopsy

-

Most important prognostic factor for melanoma à depth of lesion

-

Recommendation to prevent melanoma à avoid sun or use protective clothing (sounds absurdly
obvious, but I’ve seen students choose wrong answers like use SPF30)

-

Farmer/fisherman/construction worker + red, scaly lesion on ear/forehead; Dx? à actinic keratosis

-

Above patient with ulcerated lesion emerging from the red scaly lesion; Dx? à SCC à need to know
actinic keratosis is precursor to SCC

-

Risk factor for SCC apart from the sun à USMLE is obsessed with immunodeficiency and smoking,
even for cutaneous SCC

-

Biopsy of SCC? à keratin pearls + intercellular bridges

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 19

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

Old scar or burn + new ulcerated lesion à answer = SCC (Marjolin ulcer) à chronically irritated area /
burn / scar can lead to SCC (when I was in MS4 I saw an older woman with a Marjolin ulcer on her
chin from a chickenpox scar she had since she was a kid)

-

Ulcerated lesion on nose or pinna of ear + rolled/heaped-up edges à BCC

-

Ulcerated lesion + telangiectasia visible à BCC

-

Biopsy of BCC? à islands and nests of basophilic cells (dark purple)

reaction

-

Most common blood transfusion reaction? à febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction

-

Tx for febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction à acetaminophen on the NBME, not prednisone

-

What causes febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction? à Abs against donor MHC antigens on RBCs
or cytokines from leukocytes in the donor blood

-

Blood transfusion + fever + chills + flank pain + hypotension à ABO mismatch (and positive Coombs)
Decreased hemoglobin + increased bilirubin 2-4 weeks after blood transfusion; Dx? à delayed

memorize it)

-

Blood transfusion + dyspnea + hypoxemia + bilateral pulmonary infiltrates; Dx? à TRALI (transfusion
related acute lung injury)

-

What causes TRALI? à donor Abs against recipient MHCs à activated neutrophils cause alveolar
damage à most common cause of transfusion-associated death

-

Dude moves into new apartment building and uses the hot tub a lot + has low oxygen sats + dyspnea
+ crackles at lung bases + no wheezing + low-grade fever à answer = hot tub lung (outrageous, but
an answer on an NBME exam) à caused by hot tube fumes; not related to Pseudomonas (hot tub
folliculitis) (weird factoid to end this pdf but we’ll run with it)

Clinical and statistical significance
1.

A 44-year-old pharmacologist comes to the clinic for a routine follow-up of his hypertension.
Current medications include lisinopril and atenolol. The physician tells the patient about a novel
agent for hypertension that has recently been approved. A randomized-controlled trial found that
use of this agent was associated with a 1 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure compared to
lisinopril (p = 0.04). The patient asks the physician why bother mentioning the drug for his care if
the reduction in blood pressure found in the study was so insignificant. Which of the following is
the most appropriate response by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“Even though seemingly marginal, there was significance in this study.”
“I’d like to discuss with you all potential options for your care.”
“I think this agent could be better for you.”
“The novel drug is significantly better so should replace lisinopril in your regimen.”
“While clinically significant, the difference is not statistically significant as you’ve noted.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 5

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
The novel agent demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of blood pressure, albeit a
marginal clinical significance – i.e., even if the agent reduces blood pressure 1 mmHg compared to
lisinopril, the practical implications of this are likely ostensible at best. The patient, who is a
pharmacologist, is astute to the concept of clinical trials and had asked a question to the physician
that must be responded to openly and non-defensively.
Choice A ignores the patient’s question and reiterates, “This drug had statistical significance albeit
minimal clinical significance.”
Choice C is a prevarication. If the drug likely demonstrates lack of clinical significance, why
would the physician truly believe it would be better for the patient.
Choice D is evasive and imposing.
Choice E is inverted. The drug demonstrated statistical, not clinical, significance.

Public health screening
2.

A neonate is about to receive a heel-prick test by an obstetrics nurse. The mother says she’s okay
with him receiving a vitamin K injection and hepatitis B vaccination, but doesn’t want unnecessary
interventions for her child. She says, “The notion of taking his blood for the sake of it? Don’t you
think we’ve already been through enough here?” Which of the following is the most appropriate
response?
A) “Detecting preventable causes of mental retardation as early as possible is important.”
B) “High specificity of heel-prick testing as a screening implementation is advantageous in most
scenarios.”
C) “I understand your concerns. You can refuse it if you’d like. This is important to screen your
baby for different conditions.”
D) “Mam, this is not unnecessary. We need to screen your child for preventable causes of mental
retardation.”
E) “You’ve been through a lot. I understand.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 7

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
Heel-prick tests are done at birth to screen for conditions that, if not found as early as possible,
could result in mental retardation for the child. PKU, galactose disorders, and congenital
hypothyroidism are among the most frequently assessed conditions via heel-prick test.
Choice C communicates to the mom that she has the right to refuse the heel-prick test for her child,
while simultaneously communicating that it is important to perform. If the mom refuses, this
should be documented.
Choices A and B ignore the mother’s concerns and merely reiterate the purpose of the test.
Additionally, choice B is overly technical and verbose as a communication style in this setting.
Choice D merely refutes the mom’s concerns without actually addressing them from a place of
empathy.
Choice E is a nominal empathetic response in this scenario and does not communicate to the mom
the importance of the test.

A 64-year-old man with a 35-pack-year history of smoking inquires about his risk for lung cancer.
He says his wife keeps nagging him to ask the doctor about his risk of cancer. The physician tells
him that, yes, he does fit the criteria in which a low-dose annual chest CT would benefit him for
screening purposes. The patient replies, “You think I’m a moron. You wanna give me more
radiation when that’s not gonna do garbage for me at this point.” Which of the following is the
most appropriate response by the physician?
A) “The best way to prevent lung cancer is to quit smoking. Would you like to discuss some
possible methods for quitting?”
B) “Yes, it’s radiation. A yearly x-ray is also an alternative for you if you don’t want CTs.”
C) “Yes, it’s radiation. But a CT of your chest performed yearly is considered to be
beneficial for you.”
D) “You don’t have to undergo CTs if you don’t want to.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 9

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
The US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) recommends annual low-dose CT scans of the
chest for patients age 50-80, with at least a 25-pack-year history of smoking, and who currently
smoke or quit within the past 15 years.
Choice C addresses the patient’s concern about radiation while simultaneously upholding
beneficence by communicating that CTs are still beneficial for him.
Choice B is wrong because x-rays are not an equivalent alternative to low-dose annual CT
screening.
Choice D, although true, does not uphold beneficence. The physician still needs to communicate
that the patient will benefit by receiving a low-dose annual chest CT. The patient can refuse, but
this should still be communicated.
Choice A is a mechanical and sterile response that doesn’t address the patient’s concerns.

General patient commnunication
4.

A 72-year-old woman with osteoporosis asks about any drug trials being conducted for her
condition. The physician is aware of a recent drug that has been released onto the market, although
he does not believe it should be used specifically in her case. He communicates this to the patient.
She wants to start the drug anyway and says she will consider going to another physician who will
be more lenient with her. What is the most appropriate response in this case?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“I understand you want the best treatment possible, however this drug isn’t ideal for you.”
“I understand you want to try the new agent.”
“I will transfer you to another physician but will first need to document this conversation.”
“We should implement weight-bearing exercise for you.”
“Why do you believe this drug would be helpful for you?”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 11

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is A.
This response communicates both empathy for the patient’s desire for optimal care while also
being firm that the new agent is not ideal for her.
Choice B communicates empathy without conveying a clear stance on the novel agent, which the
physician clearly believes is not suitable for the patient.
Choice C is an insensitive and tone-deaf response.
Choice D is first-line prevention and treatment for osteoporosis but doesn’t relate to this scneario.
Choice E is wrong because the patient doesn’t know anything about the new drug.

Bradford-Hill criteria
5.

A clinical trial is performed to establish the relationship between a risk factor and a disease.
Which of the following are among the criteria for establishing causality?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Biological gradient, consistency of findings, sensitivity of test
Biological gradient, sensitivity of test, specificity of the association
Biologic plausibility, sensitivity of test, specificity of the association
Consistency of findings, specificity of the association, temporal sequence of association
Sensitivity of test, biologic plausibility, temporal sequence of association

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 13

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is D.
Student says, “Wtf?”
Students preparing for Step 3 should know the Bradford-Hill criteria, as these (annoyingly) show
up on the MCQ component. Do they sound low-yield and dry? Yes. But it’s not our opinion that
matters. It’s what shows up on the actual exam that does.

Data interpretation
6.

A 62-year-old man is enrolled in a clinical study looking at an enzyme marker for pancreatic
cancer. The enzyme levels in the population are normally distributed, with an average of 100
mg/dL and standard deviation of 10 mg/dL. Increased serum levels are directly correlated with
increased risk of cancer. It is determined that 2-3% of people would benefit from an annual CT of
the abdomen. The patient’s serum levels are 110 mg/dL. The patient asks if he should receive CTs
but doesn’t want radiation. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“I understand medical tests are annoying. We don’t have to do things you don’t want.”
“I understand you don’t want to receive radiation and that’s okay.”
“The results suggest you wouldn’t benefit from CTs.”
“Would you mind please telling me more about your understanding of CT scans?”
“You don’t need to have any radiation if you don’t want, but the results suggest you’d
benefit.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 15

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
The patient wouldn’t benefit from CTs, so this should be communicated to him plainly.

If 2-3% of people would benefit from a CT scan, then those who have serum levels of the marker
greater than ~2 standard deviations above the mean should be considered for this diagnostic
intervention.
Roughly 95% of the population falls within 2 standard deviations +/- of the mean, which means
roughly 2.5% fall below 2SD, and 2.5% above 2SD.
120 mg/dL = 2 standard deviations above the mean = ~97.5%tile à roughly 2.5% of the
population has serum levels above 120.
80 mg/dL = 2 standard deviations below the mean = ~2.5%tile à roughly 2.5% of the population
has serum levels below 80.
80-120 mg/dL = +/-2 SD from the mean = ~95% of the population has serum levels within this
range.
Since we are only concerned with patients who have high serum values, the top 2-3% (i.e., those
who are >2SD above the mean) should be screened with CT.
This patient has a result of 110 mg/dL, indicating he is only 1 SD above the mean (~84%tile). +/-1
SD from the mean is +/- 34% of the population, where 68% of people fall between +/-1SD (in this
case, 90-110 mg/dL).

Purpose and design
- Very small # of volunteers
- Pharmacokinetics + pharmacodynamics
- Determines if drug interacts with its expected target
- Single, low dose (<1% of calculated dose required to produce clinical effect)
- Not expected to show clinical effect or significant adverse effects
- Helps choose between chemical analogues for further investigation
- “Is it safe?”
- Small # of volunteers
- Dosage range for safety
- Escalation of dose ends when unacceptable side-effects occur; prior dose is
determined to be the maximum dose tolerated
- Identifies common side-effects
- “Does it work?”
- Small-moderate # of patients with disease
- Explores efficacy within safety range
- Multiple doses to establish efficacy, often against placebo
- Reveals less common side-effects
- “Is it better?”
- Larger number of patients randomly assigned to the study drug or standard of
care
- Final determination/confirmation of efficacy and safety
- Multiple doses confirming clinical efficacy
- Compares study drug to current standard of care
- “What type of efficacy and adverse effects am I observing in my personal
practice?”
- Post-marketing surveillance of patients following approval of the drug
- Healthcare practitioners report any adverse effects encountered in clinical
practice
- Provides surveillance for rare outcomes

Phase III is characterized by comparing the new drug, sacubitril, with the current treatment,
valsartan, alone or in combination. Both answers C and D refer to phase III studies, however the
study hypothesis is that efficacy will be demonstrated specifically when sacubitril is combined
valsartan. The aim of the study is not to demonstrate efficacy of sacubitril alone versus valsartan
alone.
It should be noted that valsartan/sacubitril is a real drug combination sometimes used for heart
failure. Sacubitril is a neprilysin inhibitor. Neprilysin is an enzyme that breaks down atrial
natriuretic peptide. Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker.
Phase 0 would refer to testing the pharmacokinetics and -dynamics sacubitril on a very small
group of healthy volunteers and/or patients with disease.
Phase I would entail testing for the safety, toxicity, and dosage of sacubitril.
Phase II testing would assess for efficacy of the drug (i.e., for effects on BP, EF, etc.).
Phase IV is the answer if physicians report on their findings and/or adverse effects of the drug after
it has already been on the market – i.e., post-marketing surveillance.

A pharmaceutical company has developed a new immunotherapy agent, Drug X. Early studies
demonstrated preliminary efficacy against both metastatic melanoma and actinic keratosis.
However, studies also found that 10% of patients developed severe myelosuppression and 2%
died. Which of the following is the most likely decision to be made by the FDA regarding this
agent?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Another study will be requested
The novel drug will be approved for both conditions
The novel drug will be approved for metastatic melanoma only
The novel drug will be approved for actinic keratosis only
The novel drug will not be approved for either condition

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 21

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
Risk/benefit analysis is an important step in determining whether a novel treatment should be used
in clinical practice. The benefits of treatment need to be weighed against risks. In this case, we
have a novel agent that causes severe myelosuppression in 10% and fatality in 2%, making it very
dangerous.
Although a precursor to SCC, actinic keratosis carries excellent prognosis and is curative with
treatment methods such as cryotherapy. Using a novel therapy with high morbidity and mortality
would be inappropriate.
On the other hand, metastatic melanoma carries a very low survival rate and effective management
options are limited. Therefore, the benefits of this drug make FDA approval for only this condition
most likely.

This is a “weird” question but valuable for USMLE.
US federal requirements for children involved in research state that both parents must give

One parent may give consent if the second parent is unavailable or deceased.
It is never appropriate to enroll a minor in a research study without parental consent.

Choice of study type
11. A group of researchers is interested in finding out whether IV drug-use by patients at a select
hospital is associated with increased risk of atrial myxoma compared to non-drug-users. A study is
performed by searching through medical records of patients who have history of IV drug-use
versus the medical records of those who do not have history of IV drug-use. Which of the
following best describes this study design and why it was chosen?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)
F)

Case-control study; myxoma cases not well-documented at the select hospital
Case-control study; myxoma cases well-documented at the select hospital
Prospective cohort study; myxoma cases not well-documented at the select hospital
Prospective cohort study; myxoma cases well-documented at the select hospital
Retrospective cohort study; myxoma cases not well-documented at the select hospital
Retrospective cohort study; myxoma cases well-documented at the select hospital

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 25

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is E.
Cohort studies always move in the direction of risk factor à disease. That is:
Group with risk factor vs Group without risk factor à did they develop the disease.
Case-control studies are the opposite. They move in the direction of disease à risk factor. That is:
Group with disease vs Group without disease à did they have the risk factor.
Case-control studies are ideal for assessing rare conditions. If you want to determine whether, e.g.,
a rare type of pancreatic cancer is caused by smoking, it is not feasible to do a cohort study
because this would entail needing to follow smokers vs non-smokers and seeing whether over time
they happen to specifically develop this rare type of cancer.
Instead, a case-control study would enable first starting with a group of patients who have the rare
type of cancer and then simply looking back to see whether they were smokers or not.
So where does retrospective cohort study come into play?
Cohort studies are almost always prospective. Once again, they are always in the direction of risk
factor à disease. But if the process has already happened and you’re looking at medical records,
then your observations are retrospective, and we call it a retrospective cohort study.
If a hospital has not specifically documented its myxoma cases, then there’s no way to start with a
case-control study because we don’t have a way of assembling a case (disease) group. In this
scenario we’d be forced to say, “Well our original question is whether IV drug-use relates to
development of myxomas, but we don’t have a way of isolating out those who developed
myxomas, so we’d have to manually and cumbersomely look back through the medical records of
IV drug-users vs non-drug users to see who developed myxoma at this hospital.”
Bottom line: Case-control studies are always disease à risk factor. Cohort studies are always risk
factor à disease. Almost all cohort studies are prospective. Retrospective cohort studies are
applied in a public health setting when the research entails looking back through the medical
records of those who had a risk factor vs no risk factor and seeing whether they developed the
disease.

Choice B is wrong because you do not need to justify or explain to a patient why you may have
been late. A quick apology, followed by immediately addressing why the patient has come to see

The correct answer is C.
The individual who is performing the surgery draws the X. The attending surgeon does not need to
be supervised doing this.
The patient is not the one who draws the X. A student might say, “Well how is it possible that the
patient him or herself literally wouldn’t know which limb is to be operated on?” But the rule is:
he/she who is performing the surgery is the one who draws the X.

appropriate response by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)

“Don’t worry, I won’t talk to her about anything.”
“I understand, but I am legally required to discuss these things with a parent.”
“I will not talk to her about your sexual activity, but I must discuss the UTI with her.”
“If I don’t mention your UTI to her, I won’t be able to give you antibiotics, but you
need them.”
E) “Would you mind telling me why you don’t want me to discuss these things with her?”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 33

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
Minors have the right to confidentiality without parental consent for sexual health,
obstetric/gynecologic care, drug-use, and/or mental health management.
In this case, the minor has a right to have her sexual activity withheld from her parents. Breaching
this confidentiality jeopardizes non-maleficence – i.e., it does harm if she believes there will be
punative measures against her if her mom knows. The result is she may not seek continued care
with the physician, or may learn to distrust doctors in general, putting her at greater risk for
problems going forward.
Even though sexual activity is one of the greatest risk factors for UTIs, the latter in and of
themselves do not fall under the envelope of conditions that can be withheld from parents. This
child needs antibiotics for her UTI. The consent of her mom is required. This needs to be
communicated to the minor.
If the minor is emancipated, then no parental consent is required, even for UTI management.
Emancipated minors are those who are not dependent on their parents for everyday life and are
therefore eligible to make healthcare decisions without parental consent. This refers to minors who
are in the military, living independently (e.g., a high-school graduate with a full-time job who lives
away from home), or who have children of their own whom they support. Non-emancipated
minors require parental consent for most conditions until the age of 18. An important exception is
healthcare in a life-threatening situation (e.g., emergency blood transfusions).

E) “Would you like for one of our nurses to sit in with the two of us?”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 35

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is E.
Offering to have a female member of staff sit in during the consult is one effective way to make
parents feel more comfortable leaving their children alone with a physician.
If the mother ultimately refuses to allow her daughter be left alone with the physician, this must be
respected, but also documented. However offering to have a female member of staff sit in during
the consult is a solution that should first be attempted.
If the physician suspects child abuse, he or she must contact child protective services, but this is
not advised in a setting where abuse is not specifically suspected.
Choice A is dismissive of the parent’s refusal.
Choice B is a reiteration of what the physician already attempted prior to the parent’s refusal.

D)
E)

Ask questions while both the patient and mother are present together
Ask the mother to leave the room before asking the patient questions
Ask the patient to leave the room before asking the mother questions

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 37

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
Similar to the previous question, the first step in attempting to ask a minor questions is kindly
asking the parent to step out. If the parent refuses, offering for a female member of staff to sit in is
sometimes effective. If the parent refuses again, his or her wishes must be respected, followed by
proper documentation by the physician. If the physician does not suspect abuse, there is no need
for reporting. Parents have a right to refuse physicians spending time with their children.

approximately 8 months. Which of the following would make this patient ineligible for hospice
referral at this time?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Insufficient stage of cancer
Patient prognosis
Patient declination of aggressive treatment
Periodic thoracentesis
There are no contraindications for hospice care at this point in time

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 39

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
Eligibility for hospice care necessitates terminal illness with a prognosis of <6 months of life
remaining. The patient must also not be pursuing, or interested in pursuing, any type of lifeextending management.
The stage of pancreatic cancer cancer is irrelevant. If the patient had Stage 1 cancer and a 4-month
prognosis, he would be eligible for hospice care insofar as he is not interested in pursuing lifeextending measures.
Types of management that make a patient ineligible for hospice care include any type of chemo- or
radiotherapy, as these extend life.
Sounds highly specific and weird, but USMLE 2CK wants you to be aware that thoracentesis is an
acceptable management to be received by those in hospice care. The implication is that those with,
e.g., malignant pleural effusions, may receive thoracentesis to improve symptoms, but the
management in and of itself does not extend life.

step in management?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Allow the patient to leave hospice and inform him he will not be eligible to return
Allow the patient to partake in the clinical trial while in hospice
Do not allow the patient to leave the hospice
Request psychiatric evaluation of the patient
Transfer the patient to palliative care

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 41

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is E.
Patients who are receiving hospice care are free to leave at any point if they wish to pursue more
aggressive management of their condition. The requirements for hospice admission are terminal
illness with prognosis of < 6 months and no pursuit of life-extending treatments.
Choice A is werong because the patient is free to resume hospice care if he wishes to terminate his
prescription of the new drug. While patients are allowed to take medication while in hospice, this
new drug may improve prognosis and therefore is considered life-extending, meaning it cannot be
taken while in hospice care.
The aims of palliative care are to optimize quality of life and mitigate suffering in patients who
may have >6 months of life remaining and who may be seeking life-extending management.
Palliative care happens in hospital. Hospice care occurs wherever the patient calls home.
Palliative care may be paid by insurance or self-pay. Hospice care is covered by Medicaid,
Medicare, or insurance.
Bottom line: Patients in hospice who wish to pursue life-extending management may be
transferred to palliative care.

20. A 75-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset severe headache,
nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and neck stiffness. He was in his usual state of health until this
morning when the symptoms began. His past medical history is significant for hypertension
managed with hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril. He was in a serious car accident 20 years ago
that left him in a coma for one month. A non-contrast CT of the head confirms subarachnoid
hemorrhage. Despite the best efforts of the physicians, the patient’s condition deteriorates and he
becomes non-responsive over the next few hours. Brain-stem reflexes are absent. The patient
cannot breathe spontaneously and is pronounced brain-dead. The physicians are preparing to
discontinue life support. However, the patient’s spouse and children insist that the patient had
beaten the odds multiple times before and that they are certain he will recover again. Moreover,
they have seen many reports about miraculous recoveries. They threaten to sue the physician if life
support is discontinued. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Continue life support
Consult the hospital ethics committee
Do an electroencephalogram (EEG)
Transfer care to another physician
Withdraw life support

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 43

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is E.
Physicians are not required to provide futile care when there is no prospect of the patient
recovering. In this case, the patient is brain-dead and further treatment would not change his
prognosis.
EEG and MR angiography can be considered in uncertain cases but are not required to diagnose
brain-death in this patient.
Absence of brainstem reflexes and apnea test prove brain-death. Coma and brain-death should not
be confused. Treating a brain-dead patient is futile, while treating a comatose patient is not.
The hospital ethics committee can be consulted when there are differences in opinion between
family members regarding what an incapacitated patient might want in terms of care.
Transfer of care to another physician is the answer on the USMLE if a patient wishes to
discontinue life support but the physician wishes not to do it. This is on the NBME exams. The
implication is that care will be discontinued as per the patient’s autonomy and wishes, but the
physician who is strongly opposed to the discontinuation distances him or herself from the
decision for emotional reasons. Transfer of care to another physician is acceptable in this scenario.

Terminal diagnoses
23. A 75-year-old man with cholangiocarcinoma presents for an appointment to discuss his recent PET
scan. New hepatic metastases are identified. The patient appears despondent and has little interest
in pursuing further treatments. At the end of the visit he asks the physician to prescribe him
enough opioids to “go to sleep and never wake up.” Which of the following is the most appropriate
next step by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Ask the patient why he made such a request
Consult psychiatry
Hospitalize the patient involuntarily
Hospitalize the patient voluntarily
Prescribe meperidine

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 49

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is A.
The patient has received difficult news and is at high risk of depression. He needs to be
communicated with empathetically and provided all support services possible. Further discussion
with the patient will be beneficial for his ability to cope with the poor prognostic information.
Psychiatric liaison may provide benefit for this patient if he develops major depression due to a
medical disorder. However in this current scenario, the patient’s thought process merely needs to
be explored further. Consultation with psychiatry is premature.
Hospitalizing the patient, voluntarily or involuntarily, is not necessary at this time. If he
communicates suicidal ideation, involuntary admission to hospital would be required.
Meperidine is a highly addictive opioid. Although the patient is visibly distressed about the news,
prescription of opioids at this time would be unethical.

Pain management in terminally ill patients
24. A 60-year-old male with advanced pancreatic cancer has been transferred to hospice. He is
suffering from severe pain and on a fentanyl patch. While crying, he says, “I just want all of this to
end. I’m really unhappy. I just don’t want to be depressed anymore.” Which of the following is the
most appropriate next best step by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Administer additional pain medication at low doses
Administer high-dose opioids despite risking respiratory depression
Ask the patient what upsets him
Commence the patient on sertraline
Consult psychiatry

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 51

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
Patients who are in severe pain can appear as though they have major depression even when they
do not. Pain control is one of the most important facets of ethics for USMLE. Always fully treat
pain, even if the patient has history of drug abuse.
It is acceptable to give high doses of pain medication that may inadvertently facilitate end of life.
When you are answering tough questions on USMLE, the general rule is: never withhold adequate
pain management no matter what. It is never okay to allow patients to suffer from pain.
It should be noted, in contrast, that physician-assisted suicide (e.g., prescribing high doses of
benzodiazepines to a patient who wants to end his or her life) and euthanasia (intentionally ending
a patient’s life, unrelated to pain management) are illegal in most of the United States. Ethical
views vary among physicians.
The USMLE will not ask questions with equivocal answers. Your knowledge going into the exam
should be simply:
Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia are not acceptable. Always fully treat pain.

25. A 78-year-old man with a past medical history significant for terminal multiple myeloma has been
hospitalized due to hip fracture. The patient has been bed-bound for the past month and is deemed
a poor surgical candidate. Morphine is used to manage pain. Following admission, the patient
develops pneumonia and a decision is made to provide comfort care only. The patient’s respiratory
rate is 6/min with an oxygen saturation of 89% on room air. Blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg. He
still complains of unbearable pain. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in
management?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Administer naloxone
Decrease the dose of morphine and administer oral ibuprofen
Increase the dose of morphine
Maintain the dose of morphine and add intravenous acetaminophen
Send for a ventilator

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 53

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
Increasing the dose of morphine increases the immediate risk of death for this patient. However
this patient has already been deemed terminally ill and has been put on comfort measures only.
While physician-assisted suicide (with the exception of a few states) is illegal, interventions that
may hasten the end of life are considered ethically permissible if they aim to reduce pain.
It is the aim of the intervention that is important. This patient is still in pain. Increasing the dose of
morphine is appropriate regardless of whether it may hasten end of life. Prescribing medications to
a patient with the aim of facilitating death, on the other hand, is unethical, and almost always
illegal.
Intravenous acetaminophen is highly effective for minor pain. In the setting of a patient on opioids
with cancer pain who needs even more pain relief, acetaminophen is unlikely to be effective. The
difficult takeaway here is: fully treat pain, even if it facilitates respiratory depression and end of
life.
Bottom line: Managing pain is ethically permissible even if it hastens end of life.

Establishing competence
26. A 77-year-old man with Alzheimer disease is being evaluated for pneumonia. However, upon
suggesting hospitalization and antibiotic management, the patient declines treatment. The
neurologic examination shows poor short-term memory and no focal findings. He can follow
simple commands and has intact retrograde memory. Which of the following is most accurate with
respect to this patient?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

The diagnosis of Alzheimer disease makes the patient incompetent
The normal neurologic examination makes the patient competent
The patient’s diminished short-term memory makes him incompetent
The patient’s intact retrograde memory makes him competent
The patient’s understanding of the consequences of his decision and the rationale provided
make him competent

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 55

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is E.
Adult patients are presumed to be competent to make healthcare decisions until proven otherwise.
It is very difficult to show an adult is incompetent. The most important aspect of determining
competence is determining whether the patient understands the possible consequences of his or her
decision and can provide some form of rationale for it, even if the physician disagrees with the
patient’s sentiments.
This patient states he does not wish to undergo any treatment. He is entitled to make such a
decision. The diagnosis of Alzheimer disease does not make one incompetent, nor does impaired
short-term memory.
Competence does not depend on the neurologic exam unless the patient is in a state of delirium
that interferes with the ability to be examined.
Retrograde memory has no impact on one’s competence to make decisions regarding personal
care.

Decision-making for the incapacitated patient
27. A 78-year-old man experiences an acute ischemic stroke. Despite treatment, the patient’s condition
deteriorates. He is able to articulate that he would like all life-saving measures to be performed. He
also has a living will expressing similar wishes. The patient then passes into a vegetative state. The
patient is accompanied to the hospital by his spouse and two adult children. The spouse is the
durable power of attorney and wishes to discontinue life-saving care. Which of the following is
correct in terms of making health-care decisions for this patient?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Follow the living will and verbal wishes of the patient
Follow the wishes of the spouse
The hospital legal team should be consulted before consulting with family
The hospital legal team should be consulted before following the living will
Two or more adult children present may override a living will

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 57

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
A durable power of attorney in healthcare is a person designated to make decisions on behalf of a
patient. If the patient becomes incapacitated, the durable power of attorney equals the patient for
all intents and purposes, surpassing in priority any verbal wishes the patient may have made prior
to incapacitation, as well as the patient’s living will.
In other words, the durable power of attorney can make all personal and legal decisions on behalf
of the patient if he or she becomes incapacitated.
There are four main types of Power of Attorney:
General power of attorney: the designated individual can perform most acts as the principal,
including managing finances and opening accounts. The general power of attorney arrangement is
terminated if the patient becomes incapacitated.
Durable power of attorney: the designated individual can act on the principal’s behalf and
includes a durable clause that maintains this power even if the patient becomes incapacitated.
Springing durable power of attorney: the designated individual becomes the durable power of
attorney only when the patient becomes incapacitated. Prior to incapacitation, the designated
individual does not act as a power of attorney for the patient.
Special or limited power of attorney: the designated individual has power limited to a specific
area, such as selling the property of the patient.
Bottom line: A durable power of attorney overrides the living will (advanced directive) in the
setting of patient incapacitation, even if the patient specified wishes to the contrary immediately
prior to incapacitation.

Do not resuscitate
28. An 80-year-old woman is admitted to hospital for chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis for the past
three hours. The patient has a long history of cardiac disease and has previously signed a do-notresuscitate (DNR) form. Subsequently, she is diagnosed with the acute ST-elevation myocardial
infarction. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Ask the patient if she wishes to override her DNR form
Immediately discharge the patient
Perform percutaneous coronary intervention
Provide comfort care only
Request the patient rescind the DNR form before treatment

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 59

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
DNR stands for “do not resuscitate”. It does not stand for “do not provide adequate medical care.”
If this patient were to develop cardiorespiratory arrest, it would be inappropriate to resuscitate her
as this would clearly violate her directive. However, the DNR form does not apply to any other
aspect of patient care and all other appropriate measures should be implemented as they would for
any other patient. Therefore, discharging the patient or withholding care would be inappropriate.
Bottom line: DNR forms are a legal order whereby a patient may refuse cardiopulmonary
resuscitation if his or her heart stops. This does not apply to interventions such as percutaneous
coronary intervention in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.

Patient privacy and medical records
29. A 65-year-old woman has been hospitalized due to an exacerbation of COPD and subsequent
pneumonia. Her status has deteriorated significantly over the past year and this is her 6th
hospitalization this year. The patient understands that her prognosis is poor but nevertheless wants
to continue with aggressive treatments. She does not want any of her family members to know that
she may not survive this hospitalization. Upon leaving the patient’s room, the physician is
confronted by the patient’s husband who demands to know the patient’s prognosis. He says that
their children live out of state and need to be informed. He is her durable power of attorney. Which
of the following would be the appropriate response by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)

“Have you spoken to your wife about this?”
“I am sorry but cannot discuss her prognosis at this time.”
“I am sorry but you will need to file an official request for release of medical records.”
“I am sorry but your wife’s condition is serious and the next few hours are critical to see how
she responds to treatment.”
E) “Your wife is stable and will make a full recovery.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 61

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
This is a “hard” question.
The patient clearly stated that she does not want her prognosis shared with any famly members.
This must be firmly respected by the physician. The patient’s spouse, although the durable power
of attorney, only acts on behalf of the patient in the medical setting if she becomes incapacitated.
While the patient is awake and communicating, the patient’s wishes must be followed.
Choice A is wrong because it equivocates the wishes of the patient despite the fact that they have
already been firmly expressed by her. The physician needs to respect the wishes of the patient and
communicate to the spouse that her prognosis cannot be discussed right now. If the physician
responds with choice A, then this might put the patient in an uncomfortable position where she
feels compelled to discuss her condition further despite not wanting to. Had the patient not
explicitly communicated a preference, then choice A might be more appropriate.

Partner notification
30. A 37-year-old married man is diagnosed with HIV following unprotected sexual intercourse
during his recent business trip to the Bahamas. The patient is reluctant to disclose the diagnosis to
his wife out of fear that she might leave him. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial
action by the physician?
A) The physician should call the patient’s wife and explain the situation
B) The physician should encourage the patient to discuss his diagnosis with his wife
C) The physician should report the case to the department of health so they can monitor the
outbreak
D) The physician should report the case to the department of health so they can notify the wife of
the possible exposure
E) The physician should not report the case due to the patient’s right to privacy

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 63

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
The department of health will be notified about the patient’s diagnosis. However in terms of the
physician’s most appropriate initial action, it is recommended that he or she first encourage the
patient to share the diagnosis with his wife. A plan to follow up with the patient should be
negotiated. If the patient refuses to voluntarily notify his wife, involuntary notification may occur
via the department of health, soliciting the testing of the wife.
The sequence for notification of partners of notifiable diseases is as follows:
Establish the diagnosis in the patient – e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV.
Counsel patient – explain nature of infection, how it is transmitted, the range of symptoms,
possible complications, treatment, and follow-up.
Motivate patient to notify partners – explain the importance of informing contacts and
preventing spread.
Negotiate plan for sexual contact – ask about current and past partners and agree who will
inform each one. Make a record of each contact with names, contact details, and plans for how to
contact.
Monitor progress – follow up with the patient about whether contacts have been notified.

lost consciousness. He also remembers vomiting several times that day. Following antibiotic
therapy, the patient’s condition improves and he is moved to the general ward. The patient’s
employer contacts the physician to ask about the patient’s current state of health and his ability to
return to work. The patient has authorized the release of all information. Which of the following
information should the physician provide?
A) A date when the patient is likely to be fit to return to work
B) A date when the patient is likely to be fit to return to work and a recommendation to keep him
away from alcohol
C) Diagnosis and a date when the patient is likely to be fit to return to work
D) Diagnosis, a date when the patient is likely to be fit to return to work, and a recommendation
to keep him away from alcohol
E) No information can be released

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 65

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is A.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires “minimum necessary”
disclosure, meaning that the physician should disclose the minimal amount of information that is
necessary (for the employer in this case).
Patient confidentiality should be maintained even if he or she has signed the release of
information. No information can be shared without the consent of the patient.
There is no need for the employer to know the exact diagnosis. While the patient should be
advised to abstain from unhealthy amounts of alcohol, notifying the employer of this
recommendation would be inappropriate. The physician should only notify the employer of the
patient’s fitness to return to work. No additional information should be shared.

He had previously expressed his desire to be an organ donor and his family has no objections.
Which of the following would be an appropriate next best step in the organ donation process?
A) Ensuring that brain-death is pronounced by the members of the transplant team
B) Ensuring that the members of the primary medical team that provided end-of-life care are not
directly involved in retrieving or transplanting organs
C) Ensuring that transplant procedures are undertaken by the patient’s primary medical team
D) Postponing the procedures if there are no potential recipients within the state
E) Transferring the patient to the facility where the potential recipients are hospitalized

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 67

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
The American Medical Association (AMA) provides ethics guidelines for organ transplantation.
The medical team involved in providing end-of-life care and pronouncing the time of death should
not be the same as the team involved in organ transplantation due to potential conflicts of interest.
It is important that the staff involved in the organ transplantation process are educated and that it is
performed at an adequately equipped facility. The organs are a national, rather than a state or local
resource, and can be transferred as needed.

response by the physician?
A) A compensation equivalent to the cost of the medical procedure only is acceptable
B) A compensation equivalent to the cost of the medical procedure and travel reimbursement

C) A compensation agreed upon personally by the recipient and donor is acceptable
D) The patient may not sell his kidney but may attempt to donate it

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 69

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is D.
Federal law prohibits the purchase or sale of organs from deceased and live donors.
Such payments have been prohibited since Congress passed the National Organ Transplant Act of
1984.
Gift law requires that any donor gifting an organ do so without monetary receipt.
Although the cost of the medical procedure and travel reimbursement may sometimes be covered
through insurance or institutionally, direct monetary exchanges between recipient and donor are
not considered ethical.

The correct answer is B.
Mandatory reporting of suspected or confirmed abuse applies to situations involving minors (under
18), elderly (60+), and/or persons with disabilities.
Domestic abuse among adults does not require mandatory reporting. Patients should be supplied
with a full spectrum of information (e.g., pamphlets, hotlines) and counseling. Treatment of
victims of domestic abuse is aimed at preventing repetitions of violence and may require a
combined effort between social services and healthcare professionals.
Bottom line: It is mandatory to report abuse of minors, elderly, and persons with disabilities.
Domestic abuse among adults should be approached from an angle of providing information and
resources to the abused, rather than reporting the abuse.

“Can you please tell me in more detail exactly what happened?”
“Did you dip your child into hot water?”
“Has your child been babysat recently by someone other than yourself?”

The correct answer is E.
The child needs to be admitted to hospital and child protect services contacted.
The parent should not be directly confronted about the potential abuse since he or she may flee
with the child, thereby putting the child at risk of further harm.
A caregiver will almost never admit the truth of his or her actions. If the physician suspects abuse,
asking for further detail is not the most appropriate step. The physician must admit the child and
contact child protect services.
If the caregiver leaves with the child despite the physician’s attempt to admit him or her, the next
step is still to contact child protective services.

she attributed to falling from a chair. On examination, a large bruise is noted on the right side of
her chest. Chest x-ray confirms fractures of the 3rd and 4th ribs. The patient mentions several
times that she has a partner who loves her very much. Which of the following is the most
appropriate response by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“Can you tell me more about your relationship with your husband?”
“Has your husband been hitting you?”
“I am afraid this looks like domestic violence to me and I am legally required to report it.”
“I am glad to hear your husband loves you but these bruises suggest he is being rough.”
“I know it is difficult to talk about abuse but I assure you everything you say is confidential.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 79

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is A.
Unlike with elder/child abuse, cases of suspected domestic abuse between adults should not be
reported without their consent. In this case, it is likely that the patient is being abused by an
intimate partner and it needs to be explored further.
An open-ended question is the best way to initiate a discussion. Once the patient becomes more
forthright about the situation, it may be appropriate to ask more direct questions.
Immediately confronting the patient’s description of the events would unlikely make her reveal the
abuse. If the patient does reveal the abuse, the next step would be to supply her with a spectrum of
information (e.g., pamphlets, hotlines) and ensure her safety by identifying a place she can go to in
the event of an emergency.

“Abortion is not something we should consider in this case.”
“Before we undertake any abortive intervention, there is a required one-week waiting period.”

“Yes, I can carry out a termination of pregnancy for you if you wish.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 81

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
Many physicians are opposed to abortions for a variety of reasons and do not wish to perform
them. They are also not required to. Since this patient has the right to terminate her pregnancy, the
physician should refer the patient to a physician who will carry out the management.
Following the 1973 United States Supreme Court landmark decision, Roe v. Wade, and subsequent

40. At the end of his shift at the state prison, a physician is asked to assist the prison personnel in an
execution of an inmate who has been sentenced to death for a mass murder. The inmate is a known
intravenous drug abuser and the prison staff anticipate difficulties obtaining adequate IV access to
administer the lethal substances. They believe the assistance of a physician would reduce the risk
of the inmate suffering. They also need the physician to prescribe a sedative a few hours before the
execution to relieve the inmate of anxiety and to certify death once the inmate’s heart stops. Which
of the following would be the most appropriate actions by the physician?
A) Prescribe diazepam; certify death; refuse to start the IV
B) Prescribe diazepam; certify death; start the IV
C) Prescribe diazepam; refuse to certify death until it is pronounced by another person; start the

D) Prescribe diazepam; refuse to certify death until it is pronounced by another person; refuse to

E) Refuse everything

Physician participation in executions or torture in any form is not allowed. The physician may not
advise the execution team on how to perform the execution, mix the drugs, or start the IV. The
physician may also not certify the death immediately after it has occurred, but only after the
inmate is pronounced dead by another member of the team. Prescribing diazepam to relieve
anxiety prior to the execution is acceptable as this is aimed solely at relieving suffering and is in
no way participating in the actual execution. It is also unethical for physicians to participate in
torture or to use their knowledge or skills in any way that would facilitate it, regardless of
circumstances and who orders it.

E)

“How do you feel about how we are medically managing your health?”
“How often do you skip your medication doses?”

“People often struggle with so many medications. How has this been for you?”
“Would you like me to call your children to help you with medications?”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 85

The correct answer is D.
It is helpful to initiate a discussion by acknowledging the difficulty the patient may be facing and
asking an open-ended question, allowing the patient to express her thoughts in her own words.
This can then be followed by more detailed and direct questions. If the patient says that she has
been struggling to take her medications regularly, then possible solutions can be explored, such as
“negotiating a contract,” which means writing things down (on NBME).
It is important not to come across judgmentally, which could make the patient defensive and less
likely to disclose any issues she may be having. The suggestion of involving the patient’s children
is not immediately appropriate at this time as there may be other causes of poor glycemic control

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 87

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is A.
When delivering bad news to a patient, one of the most important initial strategies is to ensure the
setting for communication is appropriate and the patient feels comfortable. When initiating a
conversation, it is advisable to establish the patient’s baseline understanding of need for testing so
that the rest of the conversation can be adapted to accordingly.
While it may be beneficial to the patient to have a family member there with him during the
delivery of bad news, the patient has asked point-blank what his CT showed. It is therefore the
responsibility of the physician to inform the patient of the news, sensitively and empathetically. It
is not mandatory to break bad news with family members present.
Briefly describing the findings of the CT without first establishing the patient’s understanding of
his need for the scan does not establish a communicative and empathetic framework for delivering
bad news.
Taking additional history at this moment is dilatory and circumvents the delivery of bad news.

43. A 32-year-old female athlete presents to the clinic because of a recently palpated mass in her right
breast. Further examination reveals a 3x3-cm, irregular, firm, immobile mass in her right breast,
and two enlarged, painless lymph nodes in the ipsilateral axilla. Following investigation, the
patient is diagnosed with regionally advanced breast cancer. The patient refuses to believe the

A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“I’d like to discuss with you what we will do from here.”
“I know you are very athletic. You’re right that this could be benign after all.”

“Look, everything will be okay.”
“What do you want to do from here?”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 89

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
The physician must acknowledge the patient’s feelings of denial in order to establish rapport and
engage in meaningful discussion. It is common for patients who feel healthy to struggle to grasp
the gravity of their diagnosis. Delivering bad news requires establishing the patient’s baseline level
of understanding of the situation through empathetic statements, which are then followed by a
more detailed explanation by the physician. At each step, the patient’s feelings must be
acknowledged and respected. She should be given sufficient time to process the information. It
would be inappropriate to interrogate the patient or to criticize her, just like it would be
inappropriate to say that everything is going to be fine because the outcome is impossible to know
at this point.

44. A 15-year-old boy with no significant past medical history presents to the clinic because of
discomfort in his right testicle. Following investigations, a diagnosis of invasive seminoma is
made. The physician recommends orchiectomy plus radiotherapy. The boy says he wants to
undergo full treatment. The mother consents to both the radiotherapy and orchiectomy. The father
consents to radiotherapy only. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Arrange for a court to oversee the case
Arrange for radiotherapy and orchiectomy
Arrange for radiotherapy only
Attempt to reach further consensus between the parents
Withhold management because radiotherapy only is futile

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 91

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is D.
Children cannot independently give consent to their own cancer treatment. In the event that parents
disagree regarding the nature of how management should proceed, an attempt to establish further
consensus should be sought.
If the father ultimately refuses the orchiectomy component for his son, this procedure cannot be
performed. The question as to whether to proceed with radiotherapy only in this case would be up
to the discretion of the physician.
When parents refuse cancer treatment, there are usually four main reasons:
1) They prefer alternative and/or complimentary medicine.
2) Conflicts in relation to faith.
3) Concern about adverse effects.
4) Lack of insight regarding the patient’s treatment needs.
Clinicians can usually reach resolutions with parents by listening to their concerns and engaging in
informative discussion with disclosure of all risks and benefits. Clinicians may involve secondary
consults with psychologists, ethicists, chaplains, or the palliative care team. A multi-disciplinary
approach may help all parties reach a consensus. However, ultimately, the parents have the right to
refuse any or all cancer treatment for their child who is a minor.

The after-hours patient
45. A 35-year-old woman with a history of making unnecessary emergency appointments presents to
an outpatient clinic after-hours. She insists on being seen immediately for a rash that she has had
for the past five days. She apologizes for showing up unannounced and claims she is a very busy
lawyer. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?
A) “I will check it out but in the future please try to schedule appointments during business
hours.”
B) “If you believe it is an urgent matter, I will see you now.”
C) “Please schedule an appointment during business hours.”
D) “There is an on-call physician in a nearby office who can see you right now.”
E) “This kind of behavior is inappropriate.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 93

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
It is important for physicians to set boundaries with patients. This patient is inappropriately
demanding to be seen after-hours for a non-urgent matter. The physician should be firm, but polite,
and explain to the patient that she should respect the business hours of the practice and make an
appointment. Examining the patient after-hours would only encourage similar behaviors in the
future.
Referring the patient to an on-call physician would be inappropriate since this can be resolved
during office hours.
It would be inappropriate to refer her to the emergency department for something that is unlikely
to be a medical emergency.
Telling a patient that her behavior is inappropriate would damage the physician-patient
relationship.
If the physician believes the situation is a genuine medical emergency, he or she can choose to
manage the patient or see that she receives appropriate care at an emergency department.
Physicians are not required to see patients after-hours.

Physician disagreement
46. A 75-year-old woman is being treated for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Her functional status has
deteriorated significantly and her prognosis is <6 months of life remaining. Her neurologist
recommended she be transferred to hospice care. However, during her last hospitalization for
pneumonia, another neurologist recommended her for a clinical trial and believes that a new stemcell based treatment could prolong her survival. The patient says she just wants what is best for
her. Which of the following is the appropriate next step by her primary care physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Ask the patient how she feels about hospice care and the clinical trial
Contact the two neurologists and try coordinating care
Refer the patient for hospice care
Refer the patient for the clinical trial
Request the opinion of a third neurologist

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 95

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
One of the roles of the primary care physician is to coordinate care. In this case, the two
neurologists disagree on the course of action for this particular patient. The primary care physician
should not judge the competence of two specialists by choosing which of their opinions to trust but
instead try reaching out to them and seeing whether an agreement can be reached. It is possible
that the reason the physicians disagree is that one is not aware of the clinical trial.
The final decision for any treatment is made by the patient as per her autonomy, but the primary
care physician should first try to reach an agreement between the neurologists as the next best step.
Bottom line: When disagreements arise between healthcare providers, one of the roles of the
primary care physician is to coordinate care for the patient by enhancing communication between
parties.

is informed of the rationale behind the procedure, the basics of the operating technique, alternative
treatments, and complications. She is given a list of all medications that will be used during the
procedure and informed that a resident surgeon will also be present in theater. Which of the
following could have been omitted while obtaining consent?

B)
C)
D)
E)

Alternative treatments
Complications
Medications used during the procedure
Presence of a resident surgeon
Surgical technique

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 97

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
During the process of obtaining consent, the patient must be told why the procedure is to be done,
how it is done, what possible complications there are, and whether any alternative treatment
options exist. She also needs to know who the physician performing the procedure is and if other
staff may play a role in the surgery. It is not necessary to provide a list of all medications used
during the procedure, although her relevant history of allergies and past/current medications are
paramount to know.

A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Attending physician and the nurse
Attending physician and the resident
Attending physician only
Attending physician, the resident, and the nurse
This procedure does not require additional consent once the patient has consented to
pancreatitis management

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 99

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
Consent should be obtained by the team member most familiar with the procedure who can answer
any questions the patient may have. While it may be acceptable for medical students, residents,
and support staff to accompany the attending physician while obtaining consent, in order for the
patient to be fully informed, the attending him or herself must obtain the consent.
It would be inappropriate to ask the nurse to obtain consent. Likewise, the resident does not have
sufficient knowledge of the procedure to be able to fully inform the patient. Consent is necessary
for surgical interventions. Just because the patient consented to hospitalization and pancreatitis
management does not automatically mean he consents to pseudocyst drainage via ERCP.

Language-related issues and interpreters
49. A 75-year old woman presents to the clinic because of unstable blood pressure. She is
accompanied by her 45-year old daughter. The patient is an immigrant from Guatemala and speaks
limited English. Her daughter is comfortable being the interpreter for her mother. The physician’s
knowledge of Spanish is limited. Which of the following is the best approach to this situation?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Allow the daughter to translate
Attempt to speak the patient’s native language
Provide all information in written Spanish
Speak slowly and use images to illustrate ideas
Use an official interpreter

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 101

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is E.
When a situation is non-urgent and an official interpreter can be reached, either in-person or over
the phone, this is always preferable over having family members carry out translations. This is
because family members may inadvertently alter the meaning of important communication, or a
patient may not wish to have the family member involved in certain parts of the communication
process.
Speaking slowly and using images may be advisable alongside providing written information,
however it is important to communicate to the patient in a language she can understand to reduce
the likelihood of medical error.
It would be acceptable for a family member to translate in an emergency when an official
translator cannot immediately be reached.
A physician should not use a language he or she is uncomfortable with since miscommunication
can have serious consequences.
Bottom line: Many patients will be perfectly willing to have family members carry out
translations, but in non-urgent situations the most appropriate step is to seek an official interpreter.

Ethical principles of medicine
50. A 68-year-old woman with metastatic lymphoma presents to the emergency department with fever,
dysuria, and back pain. She is diagnosed with pyelonephritis and antibiotics are prescribed. The
patient, however, wants to fight through without antibiotics because it’s going to be a full moon
tonight and that will certainly give her strength. Her husband arrives at the hospital and wants her
to receive antibiotics now. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing
this patient?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Administer intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin
Assess the patient’s decision-making capacity
Consult the hospital ethics committee
Discharge the patient as per her right to autonomy
Seek a court order giving the husband the legal power to make medical decisions

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 103

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
This is a tricky question because the patient’s autonomy must absolutely be respected, however her
decision-making capacity should first be determined. This is not unique to this situation. Any time
a patient is treated, decision-making capacity should be assessed and informed consent obtained.
Since the patient does not want antibiotics, she will be discharged without them. But before this is
done, her decision-making capacity will still be assessed. It can then be appropriately documented
alongisde that the patient chose to be discharged against medical advice.
If a patient refuses medical care, implement patient education, understanding, and informed
consent. Explore reasons behind the refusal. Then document the patient’s refusal.
The husband’s desire for the patient to receive antibiotics is irrelevant. Only if the patient becomes
incapacitated and he is her durable power of attorney would he have the ability to override her
choice to not receive antibiotics.

been >150/100 mmHg on his previous three appointments. The physician recommends lisinopril to
manage the patient’s hypertension. After a lengthy discussion, the patient declines medications.
This case best describes which of the following ethical principles?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Autonomy
Beneficence
Justice
Morality
Non-maleficence

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 105

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is A.
Autonomy refers to a patient’s ability to accept or refuse medical treatment. It is very rare for
interventions to be made against patients’ wishes, even if decision-making capacity is dubious. In
this case, the patient has elected not to take the recommended medication, thereby exercising his
right to autonomy.
Beneficence refers to the physician’s duty to do what is best for the patient. “Best” may be derived
from a combination of the physician’s judgment and the patient’s wishes. In this case, the
physician’s desire to prescribe an ACE inhibitor is acting out of beneficence – i.e., he is
recommending what he believes is best for the patient.
Non-maleficence refers to not doing harm to a patient. An example would be reducing a patient’s
unnecessary polypharmacy. Another example would be to refuse to provide certain treatments or
interventions (e.g., prescribing high-dose iron tablets instead of an ACE inhibitor because the
patient has heard iron is beneficial).
Justice refers to fairness in resource distribution, where patients in similar situations should have
the same access to care.

communications are important and sensitive, I understand. Can you just be honest with me: am I
dying? I am an adult and bear my own autonomy.” Which of the following is the most appropriate
response by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“An inverse relationship is observed between lymphocyte count and prognosis in your case.”
“Have you spoken to your parents about this?”
“I cannot discuss your prognosis with you without your parents present.”
“You will be okay. These types of things are stressful for your parents.”
“Your prognosis is not good, no. You must understand your parents are stressed.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 107

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
This is a favorite USMLE question. In these types of scenarios where the minor privately confides
in the physician, yet the parents do not want prognosis conveyed, the physician’s best response is
to ask the child how communication has been with his or her parents. The discussion should be as
open-ended as possible.
Choice C does not sound unreasonable, but it is not as ideal as first assessing the nature and scope
of the child’s communications with his parents. Choice C may place the parents in an
uncomfortable position, where the child may believe information is being hidden from him.
Choice D would be lying to the patient.
Choice E is wrong because parents have the right to refuse their children being aware of prognosis.

Refer the case to the hospital ethics committee

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 109

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
Patients have the legal right to refuse treatment even if it is life-saving. The patient was fully
informed and competent at the time when he made it clear he did not wish to have surgery. His
wishes need to be respected as per the ethical principle of autonomy.
When the patient is incapacitated and his wishes are not known, his next of kin can act as surrogate
decision makers (spouse before adult children). In this case, the patient’s wishes are known.
Referring the case to the hospital ethics committee or the courts would be inappropriate. The
hospital ethics committee can get involved when the patient’s wishes are not known and the family
members disagree on what course of action the patient would choose.
As discussed earlier, if the patient has a durable power of attorney, then if the patient becomes
incapacitated, the wishes of the durable power of attorney must be followed, even if the patient
stated views to the contrary prior to incapacitation.

The patient has the right to refuse any type of medical care, as per autonomy. The USMLE will
sometimes ask questions that seemingly have two “correct” answers. Choice C is not wrong in the
sense that the physician must not perform an ELISA on a patient who refuses. However prior to
fulfilling the patient’s wishes, out of the principle of beneficence, the physician must first explain

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 113

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is A.
A fetus is legally considered part of a woman’s body. Even if the fetus is term and could be
delivered safely, this patient has refused surgical intervention and her wishes must be respected.
She should be resuscitated to the best efforts of the physician team, but surgery cannot be
performed since she rejected it. Autonomy must be respected.
This is no different from, e.g., a woman with placenta previa who refuses a Caesarean delivery,
despite the risk of death to both her and the fetus being high.
If the mother becomes deceased and the fetus is still viable, surgery may be performed to save the
fetus. However if the mother is alive and has refused surgery, the fetus is considered part of her
body and, once again, her autonomy for no surgical intervention must be respected.
The husband’s desire to save his wife and unborn child does not overrule the autonomy of the
mother. She has the right to refuse surgery.

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 115

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
The physician should communicate that he or she understands, and then let the patient know that
she can return to the clinic at any time to receive the results.
Patients have the right to refuse information just like they have the right to refuse testing or
treatment. They do not need to provide justification for their desire to not hear information. Their
wishes must be accepted. Learning about a potential gene mutation one might have does not
necessitate mandatory disclosure from any type of public health standpoint.
In the event the patient has a communicable disease of public health significance (i.e., HIV,
hepatitis C, etc.), the patient must be informed of his or her diagnosis in order to prevent
community spread.
Patients can also request information be shared with someone else as opposed to directly receiving

B)
C)
D)
E)

“Dialysis may be continued outside of hospice care.”
“Hospice care is suitable in this case. Unfortunately this means stopping routine dialysis.”
“We will not stop your dialysis in the hospice setting.”
“What is your understanding of palliative versus hospice care?”
“Would you mind please explaining your understanding of dialysis?”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 119

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is A.
Dialysis is considered life-extending treatment. It is also very costly and time-consuming to
undergo. It is rare for hospice arrangements to include any type of dialysis as it is not considered a
mere end-of-life comfort measure.
The eligibility criteria for hospice care are that the patient is terminally ill within six months and is
not pursuing any type of life-prolonging management.
Palliative care may be explored as an option in which dialysis can be pursued. At this moment,
asking the patient about his understanding of palliative versus hospice care, the latter which would
require the cessation of his dialysis, is inappropriate, as the patient has already voiced that he
wishes to remain on dialysis.
The patient does not need to explain his understanding of dialysis in order to continue receiving it.

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 125

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is E.
Written consent is not essential. Verbal consent, while more difficult to prove, is equally valid. A
second witness to oral consent is highly advisable in case it is ever brought into question. This
patient has consented to the procedure. She is legally competent to make healthcare decisions so
there is no need for surrogate decision-making or contacting the hospital chaplain. Every attempt
should be made to provide culturally sensitive care to patients and demanding a signature would be
inappropriate.
Although asking more about the patient’s cultural and religious beliefs may be appropriate in some

Accepting gifts from pharmaceutical companies
62. A physician is asked to deliver a presentation on a novel agent sponsored by a pharmaceutical
company. The physician accepts the invitation. The company offers to prepare a poster for the
presentation, provide monetary compensation to the physician, and cover the travel costs of all
attendees. Which of the following is considered ethically acceptable?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

All of the above
Compensation for the lecturing physician and the travel expenses of the attendees
Compensation for the lecturing physician only
Travel expenses of the attendees only
Travel expenses of the attendees and the cost of the poster production

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 127

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
It is permissible for physicians invited to deliver presentations to be compensated for their time
and reimbursed for travel costs. Full disclosure of any financial ties between the company and
lecturer is essential. Moreover, if the physician participated in any way in the research project, this
also needs to be disclosed.
It is not permissible to receive travel reimbursements for merely attending, but not presenting at,
conferences, as this may preclude the ability of healthcare professionals to make impartial
assessments.
It is important to remember is that the content of such presentations needs to be decided solely by
the physician delivering the lecture. The pharmaceutical company should not be influencing the
content (i.e., by providing slides or lecture notes).

63. A physician is attending a large cardiology conference sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.
A number of practitioners from different parts of the world are presenting their research.
Inexpensive lunch is provided to all attendees. Everyone is also given a stethoscope. At the end of
the day, one randomly chosen attendee is offered a one-week holiday in Hawaii, and the physician
is notified that he is the winner. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the
physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“Hawaii? Why not Barbados?”
“I cannot accept the holiday.”
“I am unsure and would like to discuss the nature of this prize with the medical board first.”
“Thank you.”
“What more do I need to know before accepting this gift?”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 129

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
The issue of accepting gifts from pharmaceutical companies is complicated. It is generally agreed
upon that it is acceptable to take only the smaller gifts that will directly help with patient care. An
example would be educational material on healthy diets for patients with hypertension or diabetes.
It is also acceptable to have the meal.
Extravagant gifts such as a holiday in Hawaii (or Barbados) might function to unduly influence the
physician and would clearly violate ethical standards. In cases of physicians delivering lectures at
events sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, the content of the lecture needs to be fully
controlled by the physician, not the company sponsoring the event.
Choice C does not seem like an unreasonable answer, but this question is tricky in that physicians
should know concretely that such gifts are not acceptable. In other words, tempting, but no.

Accepting gifts from patients
64. A 75-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination following a successful
hip surgery. She is extremely grateful that she is able to walk again and can play with her
grandchildren. To express her gratitude, she brings the physician a basket of oranges she picked up
at the grocery store. Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“Thank you for the oranges.”
“This was very nice of you, but I cannot accept gifts from patients.”
“This was very nice of you, but I cannot accept perishable food items here in the clinic.”
“This was very nice of you, but I am allergic to oranges.”
“This was very nice of you. Let me first consult with hospital management about whether it is
okay for me to accept this gift.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 131

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is A.
Accepting gifts from patients is a difficult issue because rejecting a patient’s gift may leave him or
her feeling embarrassed or shameful, inadvertently causing harm to the doctor-patient relationship.
It is generally considered acceptable for the physician to accept low-cost gifts as per his or her best
judgment (e.g., simple food items or thank-you cards). If gifts are of notable monetary value
however (e.g., sports tickets or a wristwatch), they must be firmly and politely rejected.

Romance between physicians and patients
65. While attending a medical conference, a physician is approached by a colleague. Following a brief
conversation, both physicians develop a romantic interest in each other. They share a beer together
and have an intimate encounter. Soon afterward, the colleague reveals to the physician that while
she was in medical school, she attended a resident-run clinic and he treated her for a brief episode
of major depression. She assures him that she is fine now and would like to continue the
interaction. Which of the following is the correct response?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“Alright.”
“It is always inappropriate to date former patients.”
“It is always inappropriate to date other physicians.”
“I’m sorry, but we need to end our interaction.”
“Since it was a long time ago, it is a possibility. I will consult the ethics board first.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 133

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is D.
It is always unacceptable to date any current patients and former psychiatric patients.
While it is generally advisable to avoid dating any former patients, if the patient had been treated
for a non-psychiatric condition, the relationship would be permissible if the physician-patient
relationship had been terminated at least 6 months to 2 years prior.
There are no rules against physicians dating other physicians insofar as no ethical or legal rules are
broken (e.g., sharing patient information, or inappropriately referring patients between each other
to increase number of visits).

Prescribing for family members
66. A physician receives a call from his sister, a 45-year-old female with no significant past medical
history who complains of sleep deprivation. She works as an attorney and has numerous important
cases coming up, the outcomes of which determine whether she becomes a partner at her law firm.
She says that her regular physician has always been giving her zolpidem but she has been unable
to get an appointment on time. To the best of the physician’s knowledge, his sister is reliable and
has never abused any substances. She is asking for a single zolpidem prescription until she can
schedule an appointment with her primary care physician. Which of the following would be the
most appropriate response?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“Can you first show me one of the previous prescriptions you were given?”
“Can you tell me more about why you think you need zolpidem in particular?”
“I can’t write this prescription for you.”
“Treating family members is never appropriate.”
“You should make me your primary care physician first.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 135

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
This question is “hard” because this situation seems otherwise benign/innocuous, but the correct
answer is that it is unacceptable to write a prescription in this case. The USMLE wants you to
understand when it is important to take a professional hard-line.
Treating family members and friends is generally discouraged unless it is an emergency and no
other physicians are available. In this non-urgent case, it would be inappropriate to prescribe
medication both because the physician’s sister is not his patient and because she may not be
completely honest with a family member.
She should instead be encouraged to make an appointment with her current primary care physician
and discuss the concern with him or her.
Asking for additional details is unnecessary as it would still be inappropriate to prescribe zolpidem
regardless. Naming a family member as one’s primary care physician can be problematic and
should be avoided.

Impaired colleague
67. While on his ICU rotation, a resident notices that one of the attendings has been sleepy at work.
One day, the resident notices the attending taking a couple of benzodiazepine pills during the shift.
Soon afterward, while attempting to insert a central line, the physician punctures an artery causing
a major bleed, necessitating a blood transfusion for the patient. Apart from this isolated incident,
this resident is not aware of any potential mishaps by the attending. The attending is wellrespected amongst his colleagues and is an esteemed staff member at the hospital. Which of the
following is the appropriate action by the resident?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Ask the attending if he believes his sleepiness is a concern
Ask the attending if he has been taking medications to help with wakefulness at work
No immediate action is needed as this is an isolated episode
Notify the attending that you will be reporting the concern
Report the concern without notifying the attending

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 137

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is E.
When noticing that a physician may be impaired and unable to perform his or her duties, it is a
responsibility of other members of staff to report it since their primary duty is to the patients.
In this case, it is apparent this attending’s actions are putting patients’ well-being at risk. While the
physician’s use of benzodiazepines cannot be over-speculated and needs to be appropriately
explored, at this point, the most important intervention is to prevent the physician from harming
another patient.
The exact practices for reporting impaired colleagues are not consistent across all healthcare
centers and institutions. Although in many instances colleagues are encouraged to directly discuss
concerns with each other, this attending should be reported, and it is not required that he be
notified first. Anonymous reporting is acceptable and ensures patients are maximally safe.
The degree to which the attending is professionally venerated is irrelevant in terms of the need to
be reported.

Inappropriate behavior by another physician
68. A 30-year-old woman presents to the clinic for the first time to establish care. She used to see

past medical history is insignificant. The physician proceeds to discuss health maintenance and
asks about history of Pap smears. Upon mentioning them, the patient starts crying. She reveals that
the reason she is changing clinics is because her previous physician had been asking her to take off
her clothes frequently during visitations and had been touching her. The previous physician
insisted such examinations were not out of the ordinary. Which of the following is the most
appropriate next best step?
A) Ask the patient for more details in order to first better ascertain the situation
B) Call the previous physician and ask about the patient’s history without bringing up the
patient’s complaints
C) Call the previous physician and address the patient’s complaints
D) Report the previous physician
E) Tell the patient that you are concerned and will report her previous physician

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 139

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is D.
The previous physician must be reported and the issue explored by the medical board. The patient
does not need to be notified that you will be making the report. This may also put her in an
uncomfortable position since she is attempting to confide in you.
Although it might sound reasonable to ask further questions so that one can better ascertain
whether or not to report the previous physician, this is not the most appropriate step because the
reporting needs to be done regardless. In other words, the patient has objectively changed clinics
and broken down crying saying she was concerned about her previous physician. This alone
warrants reporting.
The previous physician need not be contacted regarding the patient’s complaints.

69. A 60-year-old man presents to the clinic with shortness of breath on exertion and a cough
productive of sputum for the past three months. He has a 40-pack-year smoking history. The
physician wishes to begin a discussion about smoking cessation. Which of the following would be
an appropriate way to initiate the conversation?
A)
B)
C)
D)

“Have you ever considered nicotine patches or electronic cigarettes?”
“Have you ever thought about smoking cessation?”
“What do you think about the role smoking plays in the development of lung cancer?”
“You don’t have to quit smoking. However we should quickly discuss how things could
improve if we cut back.”
E) “Your health would improve significantly if we can get you to quit somehow. What do you
think?”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 141

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.

We need to ask an open-ended question to assess what stage of change this patient is in with
regard to smoking cessation. This is the best initial step. The patient does not need to be lectured
about harmful effects or imposed upon with methods to quit. The patient should be made aware
that he or she is in full control, and the physician should do his or her best to not communicate
from a place of condescension or judgment.
Pre-contemplation: The patient has not yet considered (i.e., contemplated) the notion of changing
his or her behavior.
Contemplation: The patient has considered (i.e., contemplated) the idea of changing his or her
behavior but not has not yet taken any concrete or tangible steps to implement such change.
Determination/Preparation: The patient is mentally committing to change but has not yet
reduced or ceased the behavior (e.g., reading pamphlets/websites about harmful effects and plans
to start the nicotine patch).
Action: The patient is now taking concrete steps to reduce or stop a behavior (e.g., has
commenced nicotine gum/patch). There is minimal stability to the patient’s behavior at this point
and chance of relapse is high.
Maintenance: The patient has stably implemented behavior to reduce certain behaviors (e.g., has
been off of cigarettes for three weeks and is currently on the patch).
Relapse: The patient has experienced a recurrence (i.e., relapse) of the behavior (e.g., was on the
patch for a month but has resumed occasional smoking).

Medical errors and prevention
72. A 25-year-old man presents to the physician with mucopurulent discharge that first appeared
several days ago. Past medical history is unremarkable. Gram-negative diplococci are seen on
gram-stain. He is administered IM ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin. Within a few minutes, the
patient develops a severe reaction requiring intubation. Which of the following best describes the
event that happened?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Medical negligence
Near-miss event
Non-preventable error
Preventable error
Swiss cheese model

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 147

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
Some medical errors are not preventable. In this case, there was no reason to believe this patient
would be allergic to either of these antibiotics, and the physician’s treatment was appropriate in
this case.
This would have been both a preventable error and negligence if the patient’s allergy history had
been previously documented and not followed.
The swiss cheese model is the notion that although individual measures relating to treatment or
management may each carry minor risks of error (i.e., things can “fall through the holes/cracks”),
when you add up a number of layers of protection and responsibility (i.e., proper communication
and documentation), it becomes much less likely that an error will occur.
Near-misses are medical errors that may have occurred had events played out differently, but
fortuitously did not transpire as such. Reporting of near-miss events is not required, although
documentation is helpful to decrease probability of subsequent occurrences.

The physician then uses a different disinfectant. Which of the following best describes the event
that occurred?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Near-miss event
Neglect
Negligence
Non-preventable error
Preventable medical error

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 149

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is A.
This is a near-miss event because a medical error would have occurred had the resident not
fortuitously intervened at the last moment. Reporting of near-misses is not required, although
documentation is helpful to reduce the probability of subsequent occurrences.
Neglect is defined as failure of a designated caregiver to meet the needs of a dependent (i.e., child,
elder, person of disability). This term does not relate to medical errors.
Negligence refers to gross deviations from normal treatment resulting in harm (e.g., operating on
the ACL of the wrong leg).
Non-preventable errors are those that could not have been prevented despite all appropriate actions
by the medical team (e.g., the patient had fibrosis around his ACL not seen on MRI, resulting in a
difficult operation and the surgeon injuring the ligament further).
Preventable errors are those that can be avoided if proper documentation and communication are
followed (e.g., awareness of patient allergies).

experiencing acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient’s primary team has already left the
hospital. In order to learn more about the patient, the on-call resident reads the sign-out and notices
that drug allergies were omitted. Which of the following would decrease the risk of similar
situations happening in the future?
A) Attaching admission and progress indices to sign-out notes
B) Ensuring more than one resident reads each sign-out note before it is passed to the on-call
team
C) Limiting the number of words in the sign-out note
D) Making sure sign-out notes are delivered in person
E) Using a standardized template for sign-out notes

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 151

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is E.
Standardization would most likely have prevented the omission of allergies from the sign-out note.
A standardized sign-out note would certainly contain the allergies section and the primary team
would not have forgotten to mention them. Checklists and standardization significantly reduce the
risk of human error in most settings (e.g., a checklist before surgery).
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests three principles of safe design:
- Standardization when possible
- Creation of independent checks
- Learning from deficits in prior designs
Making sure sign-out notes are delivered in person might help since it would enable the on-call
residents to ask additional questions, however this would not be as effective as standardizing the
forms.
Limiting the number of words might increase the likelihood that crucial information is omitted.
Moreover, it is impossible to know how many words would be necessary to properly describe any
particular patient’s condition.
Attaching admission and progress indices would help but would likely be too detailed and timeconsuming for practical implementation.

A)
B)
C)

A pharmacist participating in rounds
An improved system of reporting interactions

Providing physicians with computer databases of drug interactions

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 153

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports that a pharmacist present on rounds may
lead to a decreased incidence of prescription errors.
Additional measures that lead to decreased incidence of adverse ICU outcomes are having no more
than two patients assigned to a single nurse and ensuring that an intensivist is present on daily
rounds.
Online databases of drug interactions already exist and can be very useful in clinical practice, but
having a pharmacist available at all times reduces the incidence of prescription errors more than
such databases.

performing this analysis?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Create a causal factor flowchart
Identify root causes

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 157

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is A.
Root-cause analysis is the process of upstream/initial (i.e., root) causes of problems in order to
identify appropriate solutions.
Root-cause analysis adheres to the assumption that it is more effective to systematically prevent
and solve for underlying problems than it is to just address ad hoc symptoms after the fact.
Root-cause analysis consists of 4 steps:
- Collecting data (e.g., how dosages of opioids are administered)
- Creating causal factor flowcharts (i.e., which events led to the next)
- Generating and implementing recommendations (e.g., colored syringes with dosages)
- Measuring success of changes implemented (e.g., # of errors over time)
The hospital has already gathered data on the event, so the next step is to create a causal flowchart.
Once the flowchart is created and it becomes evident which sequence of events led to the error, it
is appropriate to develop and implement a plan to prevent similar errors from happening in the
future.

the following best describes this out-of-pocket expense referred to by the insurance company?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Coinsurance
Copayment
Deductible
Out-of-pocket maximum
Premium

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 161

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
A deductible is the amount of money a patient needs to pay each year before his or her insurance
policy starts paying. For example, this patient’s $1,000 deductible means that she is required to
cover the first $1,000 dollars of her medical bills before her insurance provider will cover
anything.
Coinsurance is the amount the patient pays to share the cost of the covered treatments after the
deductible is met. For example, if the treatment’s total cost is $2,000 and there is a 20%
coinsurance, the patient will need to pay $1,200 – i.e., the $1,000 deductable + 20% of the
subsequent insurance payment ($200 is 20% of the second $1,000).
A copayment is a flat fee for some expenses (e.g., $20 for every doctor visit).
A premium is the monthly fee of the health insurance policy.

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
If a physician believes a patient has sincerely conveyed intent to cause serious harm to a third
party, the physician must break confidentiality and notify the third party. This most saliently
applies (although is not limited to) homicidality and rape.
The “duty to warn” third parties famously stems from the 1985 Tarasoff case, where a patient had
confided to a psychotherapist murderous intent, confidentiality was maintained, and then the
patient went on to commit murder. California law now encodes the Tarasoff rule, in which
psychotherapists have a legal duty to warn potential victims of serious harm. States differ as to
their exact laws, but the duty to warn is a principle ubiquitously upheld in the medical profession
since the Tarasoff case.
Law enforcement does not need to be contacted when mere sentiments/plans have been conveyed,
since no crime has been committed yet. If a patient has confided that he or she committed serious
crime in the past (e.g., murder, armed robbery), law enforcement must be contacted.

Inpatient vs outpatient management
81. A 30-year-old woman undergoing outpatient chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma presents to the
physician with painful vesicular lesions on her back. The physician believes that a one-day
inpatient stay with IV acyclovir is most appropriate, followed by discharging the patient on oral
valacyclovir. He is aware the patient has history of hospitalization and abhors being in hospital.
Which of the following is the most appropriate way to initiate discussion regarding this patient’s
management?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“Here is oral valacyclovir for your condition. This way you don’t need to be in hospital.”
“How do you feel about entering hospital?”
“How do you feel about receiving IV treatment in outpatient emergency for the next day?”
“I’d like to admit you to hospital, but I know you’ve hated that type of thing in the past.”
“We’re going to admit you to hospital for a short stay. Is that okay with you?”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 165

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
A simple open-ended question assessing the patient’s feelings about entering hospital is most
appropriate. This exact same type of statement is also used if needing to involuntarily hospitalize a
patient for, e.g., suicidality.
IV acyclovir is the answer on USMLE for herpes zoster if the patient is immunocompromised,
undergoing chemotherapy, or is toxic (i.e., high fever, chills). If the patient merely has diabetes
mellitus, orals can be given without the need for admission to hospital (on NBME).
Choice A is wrong because this would be violating non-maleficence – i.e., we would be doing
harm to the patient if not at least offering the management we best see fit.
Choice C is wrong because this represents mismanagement of where the patient needs to be
treated. It might seem that this patient could be harmlessly managed in outpatient emergency, but
if a true crisis were to arise and maximal staff resources were needed elsewhere, that would be
doing a disservice to this patient. Patients should be accommodated in every way possible, but this
does not mean improper triage or location of care.
Choice D is a good, direct statement. But it is not as ideal as B because it is not an open-ended
question. Choice D might be appropriate if the patient responds to B by saying she does not want
to be in hospital. Now the physician needs to directly communicate his thoughts about admitting
her.
Choice E suggests an involuntary hospitalization is ensuing. This would be an acceptable answer
after choice B if the patient needed to be admitted for, e.g., suicidality.

Alternative medicine
82. A 35-year-old woman was prescribed fluoxetine six weeks ago for major depression. At today’s
follow-up appointment she tells the physician she started taking an herbal supplement a couple
days ago, as suggested by her friend, although she forgets the name of it. Which of the following
would be the most appropriate response by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“As your physician I have to tell you that these supplements are insufficiently regulated.”
“Herbal supplements are, unfortunately, ineffective against major depression.”
“How have you been feeling since starting the supplement?”
“I want you to find out for me as soon as possible what kind of supplement it is.”
“Let’s see how we can be work the herbal supplement in with our other treatments.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 167

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is D.
This is a “hard” question.
The combination of St John Wort and SSRIs can lead to serotonin syndrome. It is urgent to know
what kind of supplement the patient has started so that an adverse outcome can be prevented.
Patients who commence anti-depressants will certainly be counseled beforehand about the dangers
of taking concurrent herbal supplements, however this patient just began taking an unknown
supplement and this needs to be seriously and firmly addressed.
The reason this question is hard is because choice E is often a correct answer when patients begin
alternative or cultural remedies in non-urgent settings. For instance, if an immigrant patient is not
taking an SSRI and wants to add “elk bone marrow powder” to her daily routine, this should not be
outright rejected, but instead attempts should be made to facilitate the incorporation of cultural
remedies into the patient’s care.
Choice C is wrong because the patient could feel perfectly fine right now but then develop an
adverse reaction later. This does not directly address the underlying issue that the herbal
supplement needs to be identified.

83. A 6-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother. They are recent emigrants from SubSaharan Africa. The mother is convinced that the child has been possessed by an evil spirit and has
been keeping a bottle of water on his head to make the spirit go away. The child is diagnosed with
acute otitis media and the physician would like to give oral amoxicillin. The mother is still
convinced it is the spirit. Which of the following is the most appropriate way to address the
situation with the patient?
A) “Can you tell me more about this spirit? I want to understand your thoughts here.”
B) “Do you have a psychiatric history by any chance?”
C) “I understand you think there is a spirit. That is okay.”
D) “Let’s add an antibiotic to what you are already doing to help your child.”
E) “Sometimes we might attribute illness to things that really are not extant.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 169

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is D.
This child needs oral amoxicillin irrespective of the mother’s belief about the spirit.
It must be understood that patients of different cultural and religious backgrounds will sometimes
carry beliefs not shared by the physician. Patients and their families should not have their views on
alternative remedies outright rejected. If the remedies are otherwise harmless, the physician should
discuss how the remedy and necessary treatment can be worked in together. (This is similar to
Choice E of question 82)
If the patient wishes to incorporate a remedy the physician knows little about, he or she can do
research on the remedy (i.e., literally searching on Google) while the patient is there in order to
develop a plan. This is because the aim is to be sensitive, and not immediately dismissive of,
cultural beliefs.
Choice C sounds reasonable and is appropriate as an isolated statement. But D is superior because
it implies an acceptance of the mother’s beliefs (i.e., it doesn’t deny or refute them) while also
addressing the important management of the child.
Choice B is insensitive and communicates poor understanding of cultural beliefs.
Choice E is patronizing and verbose.

Refusal of vaccination
84. A 4-month-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his parents. The physician recommends a
number of vaccinations but the parents decline and are firm believers that vaccines cause autism.
“We don’t want to discuss this further,” they say. Which of the following is the most appropriate
statement by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“I am going to document this in the chart. If you change your mind, vaccines will be
available.”
“I am going to report this to child protective services.”
“No problem.”
“There is no evidence to suggest vaccines cause autism.”
“We don’t have to discuss this further. But you should know that vaccines do not cause
autism.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 171

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is A.
The parents have firmly stated that they do not wish to discuss this further. They have their beliefs
and these must be respected. Forcing unwanted communication in this setting can damage the
doctor-patient relationship. Parents have the right to refuse vaccines for their kids, even though
population health data is overwhelmingly conclusive as to the benefits. In addition, vaccines do
not cause autism.
The parents’ refusal should be documented. This documentation in and of itself does not need to
be communicated to the parents (choice A), but the reason this is correct over choice C is because
the parents are made aware that if they change their mind, they can still access appropriate care for
their children without an issue.
Choice C carries outright resignation.
Choices D and E can come across argumentative in this setting.

Communication with patients in cognitive decline
85. A 76-year-old man comes to the office accompanied by his wife for a follow-up appointment. He
was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer disease and was commenced on donepezil and memantine.
The patient was in the army for many years and until recently led a very independent life. His wife
says that he tried making coffee this morning and that, when she tried to help him, he got angry at
her. The physician believes that maintaining written notes and labeling items around the house
with colored text might help. The patient says, “You think I’m stupid don’t you. I’m perfectly
independent and my own man. When I was in the army guys like you took orders from guys like
me.” Which of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“Do you feel like at night when the sun goes down things get harder at home?”
“How do you feel things are going on your new medications?”
“I want to discuss with you ways I think we can make stuff at home easier.”
“I’m going to discuss with your wife about keeping ambient lights on at night.”
“We as guys need to make sure we keep our repertoire of females handled.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 173

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
The physician should simply communicate to the patient that he or she is attempting to help make
things easier at home. The physician should be sensitive to patients in cognitive decline who are
sometimes aware of their evanescing independence.
Color-coding and using labels may help patients with maintaining functionality at home for as
long as possible.
Sundowning is worsening of dementia at night, where the patient can develop delirium-like
activity. Ambient noise and distractions should be reduced, but use of night lights or keeping
rooms brightly illuminated is incorrect (2CK Psych NBME).

Sleep hygiene
86. A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of an 8-week history of emotional lability,
irritability, and fatigue. She says that she is not able to fall asleep readily despite feeling sleepdeprived. She is a law student and has been busy studying throughout the semester. Physical
examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation by
the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“Don’t get out of bed when you’re having trouble falling asleep.”
“Exercising more can help you fall asleep.”
“Sleep late whenever you can in order to catch up on sleep.”
“Sometimes having a glass of wine before bed can be helpful.”
“Try getting up at the same time every day, even if you feel tired.”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 175

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is E.
In order to establish healthy sleep hygiene, patients should be told to try to get up at the same time
every day, even if it is difficult to do so and they feel tired.
The result is they may be more inclined to go to bed earlier in the evening, which in turn will
make getting up at the same time easier, since they will have gotten more sleep per night.
People’s sleep cycles respond differently to exercise at particular times of the day. Even if the
influence of exercise is considered as a possibility in this patient’s sleep hygiene, she should still
first be encouraged to get up at the same time every day.
Patients should not be encouraged to develop an alcohol dependence in order to fall asleep.

Sensitive examinations
87. A 34-year-old woman at 34 weeks’ gestation presents to emergency with copious vaginal bleeding
and severe pelvic pain. She has not noticed any fetal movements during the past 24 hours. Blood
pressure is 95/55. Heart rate is 110/minute. Her obstetrician is a woman who lives an hour away.
The patient is dressed in a burka and explains that she is religious and does not want to be
examined by a male physician. The only physician available is a man. Which of the following is
the most appropriate action by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Ask a female nurse to perform the examination and report the findings to the physician
Ask the patient if she would permit the examination if her husband is present at all times
Do not perform the examination and implement conservative management
Obtain emergency permission from the hospital judicial committee
Wait until the patient’s obstetrician arrives

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 177

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is B.
The examination needs to be performed by a physician. The next best step is to ask the patient if
she would allow the examination if her husband is present at all times. If she declines, her wishes
must be respected as per autonomy.
Choice C is wrong because this is clearly an emergency situation. The patient has the right to
decline an examination, but before conservative management is implemented, she should be asked
if she would allow the examination with her husband present at all times.
Choice E is not practical in an emergency scenario.

Unexpected results in relation to demographic
88. An 81-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter to discuss the results of a
cognitive work-up. The patient has had worsening anterograde amnesia for the past 6 months. Her
Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score is 22/30. Serum studies demonstrate a positive result for
fluorescent treponemal antibody. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the
physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

Discuss the results with the daughter only
Discuss the results with the daughter and patient together
Discuss the results with the patient only
Obtain serum TSH
Repeat testing and follow-up in 3 days

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 179

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is C.
The patient has a positive test for syphilis, suggesting that her cognitive dysfunction might be due
to neurosyphilis. These results should first be discussed with the patient only. Her decision-making
capacity should be assessed during the examination and documented accordingly.
Just because the patient has a low MMSE score does not in and of itself warrant that the daughter
be present during the disclosure of test results. The patient’s right to confidentiality must be
respected.
If the patient ultimately refuses treatment for syphilis, this must be respected and also documented.
Hypothyroidism and B12 deficiency are reversible causes of dementia, however this patient is
positive on syphilis screening, so she should be treated with penicillin as the next best step in
management.

89. A 13-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of a 3-cm rubbery mass
palpable beneath the left nipple. She is Tanner stage 3. Family history is remarkable for the
patient’s grandmother passing away from breast cancer at age 57. Which of the following is the
most appropriate communication by the physician?
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“How do you feel about having a biopsy of the mass?”
“How do you feel about having your blood drawn so we can check some hormone levels?”
“I know you must feel really concerned about this. A biopsy is most appropriate.”
“This typically resolves over 12-18 months.”
“What is your understanding of breast masses?”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 181

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is D.
Breast masses are normal findings in both boys and girls during puberty. This is referred to as
physiologic gynecomastia and typically resolves within 12-18 months.
Sometimes one breast might develop a lot more quickly than the other. This is also benign and
referred to as virginal breast hypertrophy.
Hormones do not need to be checked in this girl as she is otherwise developing fine. It is highyield to know that once a girl reaches Tanner stage 3, menarche is imminent (this is a direct
answer on a 2CK obgyn NBME). The USMLE will frequently trap students into choosing answers
relating to “check hormones,” when in reality observation is frequently the answer in pediatrics
questions.

90. A medical student is caring for a 68-year-old man who has been admitted to hospital for biopsy of
a pancreatic mass. The resident physician asks the student not to discuss results with the patient
until the oncologist has evaluated the findings. During preparation for ward rounds, the student
goes to the patient’s bedside to grab the drug chart and notices the electronic medical chart was
updated by Pathology ten minutes ago. The biopsy result shows adenocarcinoma. The patient is
awake and asks the student, “What did my biopsy show?” Which of the following is the most
appropriate response by the student?”
A)
B)
C)
D)
E)

“I’m just a student, sir.”
“I’m not sure, but the oncologist is seeing you today.”
“I’m not sure. Let me grab the resident physician.”
“Let me grab the resident physician so we can discuss the results.”
“What is your understanding of the biopsy process?”

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 183

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
The correct answer is D.
The student was given instructions by a senior to not disclose the results. Professional conduct
must be upheld and the results not disclosed.
Choice A ignores the patient’s question. Even if the implication is, “I’m just a student, so a doctor
should discuss the results with you,” this in turn should be communicated, as with Choice D.
Choices B and C are wrong because the student is lying to the patient. This is never acceptable.
Choice E is a nominal statement that might be part of the process of breaking bad news, but in this
case the student should simply get the resident physician in order to discuss the results.

HY USMLE Review – Part IV
-

72M + drooping of left side of face + decreased muscle strength and increased tendon reflexes of
both left upper and lower extremities + Babinski on left + intact sensation; what’s the most likely
explanation for this patient’s condition? à answer = lacunar infarct of internal capsule; produces
“pure motor” stroke in most cases of posterior capsule infarct; thalamic stroke produces “pure
sensory” effects; lacunar infarcts are usually due to Hx of HTN causes lipohyalinosis of lenticulostriate
arteries.

-

24M + experiment glucose injected IV in two different scenarios: 1) when food is simultaneously
consumed orally, and 2) when no food is simultaneously consumed; experiment shows that glucose is
cleared faster from circulation when food is concurrently consumed orally; Q asks, which hormone is
responsible for these findings? à answer = glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP); secreted
in response to oral consumption of macronutrients (i.e., carbs, fats, protein); causes insulin secretion;
in other words, insulin goes up more when food is consumed orally vs merely received parenterally à
faster clearance of plasma glucose.

-

24M + receives 50g of glucose IV vs 50g of glucose orally; insulin goes up more when glucose
consumed orally; why? à answer = glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide à greater insulin
secretion.

-

6F + finds open bottle of aspirin; which of the following findings in the patient best suggests the dose
consumed was toxic? à answer = increased respiratory rate; aspirin causes respiratory alkalosis
acutely due to upregulation of respiratory centers (high pH, low CO2, no change bicarb [too acute to
change]); after roughly 20 minutes, a mixed metabolic acidosis-respiratory alkalosis is seen (low pH,
low CO2; low bicarb); the low bicarb is not compensation for the acute respiratory alkalosis; it is
merely convenient that the salicylic acid itself is an acid and drops the bicarb; tachypnea is seen
acutely as first sign (observed by healthcare practitioner); tinnitus can be reported as first symptom
(patient-reported finding); Tx with sodium bicarb à increased excretion of aspirin via urinary
alkalinization.

-

30M + shooting groin pain + increased blood pressure + mother had surgery for thyroid cancer;
what’s most likely to establish the cause of the patient’s HTN? à answer = urinary metanephrines;
diagnosis is MEN 2A à pheochromocytoma + medullary thyroid carcinoma + primary

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

3

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
hyperparathyroidism; Tx pheo with phenoxybenzamine (irreversible alpha blocker); shooting groin
pain is urolithiasis secondary to hypercalcemia; medullary thyroid cancer causes increased serum
calcitonin. For quick comparison, MEN I à pancreatic tumor, pituitary tumor, primary
hyperparathyroidism; MEN 2B à pheochromocytoma + medullary thyroid carcinoma + mucosal
neuromas + Marfanoid body habitus.
-

Neonate + strange hereditary disease + mutation analysis shows homozygous gene deletion; what’s
the most likely inheritance pattern? à answer = autosomal recessive; some students get caught up
by saying, “Wait, we’re supposed to know the inheritance pattern of this weird disease?” No. It’s the
fact that they say homozygous deletion, without mentioning that either parent has pathology, that
implies the condition is autosomal recessive.

-

Patient takes nedocromil for seasonal allergies; what’s the MOA of this drug? à answer = blocks
release of autacoids from cellular storage; student says wtf?; mast cell stabilizers like nedocromil and
cromolyn sodium prevent the release of histamine, which acts as an autacoid, which means it’s a
biologic molecule that acts as a local hormone (i.e., acts near site of synthesis).

-

84F + unilateral hydronephrosis caused by ureteral compression by a vascular structure; what’s the
structure à answer = ipsilateral common iliac artery; can compress ureter leading to hydronephrosis;
if the Q tells you the patient has cancer causing unilateral hydronephrosis, choose ovarian cancer
impinging on ureter; if Q tells you patient has bilateral hydronephrosis due to cancer, choose cervical
cancer (usually younger patient).

-

54M + progressive shortness of breath for four months + ascites + edema of lower extremities +
bilateral pleural effusions + ejection fraction of 55%; what’s the mechanism for this patient’s
increased fluid in the lungs? à answer = decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure (decreased
plasma oncotic pressure); this refers to either renal (nephrotic syndrome) or hepatic disease
(decreased production of albumin); wrong answer is “increased capillary hydrostatic pressure”
because ejection fraction is normal (55-70); this is normally the answer for pulmonary edema from
left heart failure; “increased vascular permeability” would be the correct answer in ARDS (bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates), infection (i.e., pneumonia +/- sepsis), or pulmonary embolism (local
inflammation).

-

Neonate + persistent cyanosis + normal Hct + normal RBC morphology + CXR and echo show no
abnormalities; diagnosis? à answer = methemoglobinemia due to deficiency of cytochrome
reductase B5; methemoglobinemia can lead to cyanosis; USMLE asks for cytochrome reductase B5
deficiency as cause of congenital methemoglobinemia; can lead to persistent cyanosis; should be
noted that nitric oxide used for pulmonary hypertension in neonates can cause methemoglobinemia
(oxidizes ferrous iron to ferric iron); acrocyanosis is normal blueish tinge of extremities at birth in
some neonates (treatment is place under warming lights and do tactile stimulation); Tx for
methemoglobinemia in most cases is methylene blue + vitamin C.

-

40F + fibromuscular dysplasia + GFR is within normal range; what explains this latter finding? à
answer = increased efferent arteriolar resistance; RAAS will upregulate in response to decreased renal
blood flow à angiotensin II constricts efferent arterioles, causing increased filtration fraction, where
GFR is held constant despite lower blood flow to kidney.

-

19F + external compression of left renal artery but has normal renal perfusion pressure; what explains
this latter finding? à answer = decreased afferent arteriolar resistance; just happens to be the
answer they give in this hypothetical scenario; if the afferent perfusion is decreased due to
compression of the renal artery, the only way perfusion pressure can still be unchanged is if the
smaller afferent arterioles distal to the renal artery dilate; slightly unusual Q considering the normal
physiologic response to reduced renal perfusion is simply efferent arteriolar constriction via increased
RAAS activation; but in this latter scenario, the result is maintenance of GFR despite reduced renal
perfusion, rather than a maintenance of renal perfusion.

-

27M + from Pennsylvania + Hx of splenectomy + RBCs show intraerythrocytic rings; diagnosis? à
answer = Babesia; causes Malaria-like hemolytic disorder in patients who’ve never left the United
States; ring forms and Maltese crosses can be seen within RBCs; if the Q tells you the patient went to
Africa, choose malaria, not Babesia. But if the patient didn’t leave the US, malaria is the wrong
answer.

-

How many kilocalories in one gram of fat, carbs, protein, and ethanol? à answer = 9 kcal/g of fat; 4
for both carbs and protein; 7 for ethanol; USMLE Q will give you some nutrition Q where you have to
do math, and it will rely on you knowing this nutritional info to get the Q right.

Q asks for the mechanism via which insulin acts; answer = tyrosine kinase (MAP); USMLE also wants
you to know that insulin causes ­ nuclear transcription, ­ serine-threonine kinase activity, and ¯
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.

-

Patient has infection + goes into septic shock; Q asks for what LPS binds to that causes shock; answer
= Toll-like receptors; in endotoxic shock, the lipid A of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binds to CD14 on
macrophages (toll-like receptor 4; TLR-4), resulting in macrophages releasing cytokines, namely TNF-a
and IL-1. Do not confuse endotoxic shock with toxic shock syndrome caused by S. aureus, where TSST
toxin (superantigen) bridges MHC-II and TCR, causing the macrophage to release cytokines; if the Q
mentions cotton nasal packing or tampons, choose the MHC-II + TCR combo, not CD14/TLR-4.

-

2F + missing superior left parathyroid gland; what’s the embryologic defect? à answer = fourth
pharyngeal pouch; fourth pouch = superior parathyroids; third pouch = thymus + inferior
parathyroids; easiest student fuck-up = selecting arch instead of pouch; pouches = endoderm; arches
= mesoderm; clefts/grooves = ectoderm; DiGeorge syndrome à aplasia of 3rd and 4th pharyngeal
pouches, leading to hypocalcemia, T cell deficiency with absent thymic shadow, cleft lip/palate, and
heart defects (tetralogy of Fallot; truncus arteriosus).

-

20F + recurrent Staph infections + deficiency of CD18; what mechanism best explains this condition?
à answer = failure of emigration of phagocytes to inflamed tissues; leukocyte adhesion deficiency is
caused by deficiency of LFA-1/CD18 integrin, which is required for diapedesis of leukocytes to sites of
infection; result is recurrent infections (often Staph) with absent pus; delayed separation of umbilical
cord is often omitted from Qs because it’s too easy of a detail.

-

40F + develops AML after exposure to agent; what’s the most likely agent? à answer = benzene. You
need to know benzene exposure is associated with AML. Naphthylamine is associated with urothelial
cancers (i.e., transitional cell carcinoma); vinyl chloride can cause angiosarcoma of the liver.

-

54F + treated with anti-platelet agent that prevents platelets from interacting with fibrinogen; what’s
the agent? à answer = abciximab à monoclonal antibody against glycoproteins IIb/IIIa on platelets;
these glycoproteins carry out aggregation and are normally bridged by fibrinogen; abciximab is a
fibrinogen analogue; don’t confuse aggregation (platelets to each other) via GpIIb/IIIa with adhesion
(platelets to endothelium) mediated by Gp Ib. Eptifibitide and tirofiban are lower yield drugs that also
inhibit GpIIb/IIIa; abciximab is HY agent with this MOA; HY drugs that inhibit ADP2Y12 receptor on

(answer on USMLE if patient needs AAA repair but perioperative MI risk needs to be assessed).

-

57M + asks physician why celecoxib increases risk of adverse cardiovascular events; answer = inhibits

inhibitor.

-

35F + started taking high-dose vitamins past few months as part of new dietary regimen + has cracked
lips, rough/dry skin, and alopecia on scalp; these findings are due to excess of which vitamin? à

17F + Hx of heavy menses + easy bruising + ¯ Hb + normal platelets + normal PT + ­ PTT; what factor
is she deficient in? à answer = von Willebrand factor; vWF bridges GpIb on platelets to vascular
endothelium; deficiency in vWD causes: ­ bleeding time, normal PT, and ­ PTT about half the time.
Bleeding time is always elevated because the primary role of vWF is to ensure platelet adhesion; PTT
is only increased about half the time because vWF’s stabilization of factor VIII in plasma is a mere

secondary/ancillary role. Plenty of NBME Qs will have normal PTT in vWD. Platelets can be normal or
slightly decreased. Vignette of vWD will always give a mix of one platelet problem (easy bruising,
petechiae, epistaxis) and one clotting factor problem (menorrhagia, excessive bleeding with tooth
extraction). Hemarthrosis is a clotting factor problem but is seen more in hemophilia rather than
vWD. vWD is AD; hemophilia A and B are XR.

Q asks about which of the following is most likely to disturb Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; answer =
“appreciable rate of gene mutation”; H-W assumes: there is no appreciable rate of gene mutation;
mating within a population occurs at random; the population is relatively large; there is no selection
against a particular genotype; and there is no significant immigrant population.

-

43M + elevated fasting glucose + arthritis + cardiomegaly; what’s the mechanism for this patient’s
condition? à answer = increased intestinal absorption of iron; Dx = hemochromatosis; AR;
chromosome 6; Fe can deposit in tail of pancreas, leading to diabetes; hemochromatosis and primary
hyperparathyroidism are two HY causes of pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease);
this will carry an osteoarthritis-like presentation (i.e., even with findings such as Heberden nodes), but
the vignette will be hemochromatosis and primary hyperparathyroidism, so you know the Dx is
pseudogout; Fe can deposit in the heart, leading to either dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy; Fe
can deposit in the hypothalamus and/or testes, causing infertility; “Bronze diabetes” =
hyperpigmentation of the skin due to hemosiderin deposition à e.g., patient with darkening of the
skin of the forearms, increased fasting glucose, and infertility or arthritis; answer = “check serum iron
and ferritin.”

-

6M + hyperpigmentation around the lips + colonic polyps; what kind of polyps are they? à answer =
hamartomatous; Dx = Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, characterized by perioral melanosis + hamartomatous
colonic polyps.

-

26F + hyperpigmentation + BP of 100/60 + muscle weakness; what combination of sodium,
potassium, and cortisol are expected in this patient? à answer = ¯ sodium, ­ potassium, ¯ cortisol;
Dx is Addison disease; Na is ¯ and K ­ because aldosterone is ¯. Condition is often caused by
antibodies against 21-hydroxylase, which is needed to synthesize both aldosterone and cortisol in the
adrenal cortex.

80F + colonic diverticula; which part of the colon most likely has the diverticula? à answer = sigmoid
colon.

-

Q asks about what would be increased in third trimester of pregnancy; answer = “hepatic protein
production”; in contrast, CO2 is decreased (a mild respiratory alkalosis can be seen in pregnancy);
pulmonary residual capacity is decreased because the diaphragm is pushed up; serum osmolality is
decreased due to expansion of plasma volume, resulting in dilutional effects; systemic vascular
resistance is decreased because the placental vessels add units to the “parallel circuit” of the systemic
vasculature.

-

40F undergoing chemotherapy + has low leukocyte count; what drug will help this patient? à answer
= pegfilgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF); will cause an increase in neutrophils.

-

27M + infertility + high serum testosterone + low serum LH and FSH; what’s the most likely cause of
this patient’s infertility; answer = exogenous testosterone use; testosterone-secreting tumor could
also theoretically be an answer, but only the former listed.

-

25M + has facial nerve and optic nerve on left damaged in car accident; why does he regenerate facial
movement over time but not vision? à answer = optic nerve is myelinated by oligodendrocytes;
oligodendrocyte-myelinated nerves of CNS have limited regenerative capacity compared to Schwann
cell-myelinated nerves of the PNS; facial nerve is myelinated by Schwann cells.

-

Drug is given that increases insulin release; what is the MOA of this drug? à answer = increases the
ATP/ADP ratio; theoretically, many answers could make sense here; the point is: does the student
know the mechanism for insulin release: ATP closes a K+ channel on the beta-islet cells à K+ builds
up within the cell à depolarization à Ca2+ then influxes à causes release of insulin-containing
vesicles from beta cell; in other words, if a drug increases the ATP/ADP ratio within the beta islet cell,
then theoretically that would facilitate insulin release. In real life, sulfonylureas (e.g., glipizide)
function to close the ATP-gated K+ channel without the need for ATP.

-

46M + esophageal varices; which vein is most likely to have increased blood flow? à answer = left
gastric vein; ­ portal venous pressure causes backup to left gastric vein, which backs up to esophageal
veins.

-

74M + lesion on cheek showing neoplastic cells with dense pigment granules; what’s the diagnosis?
à answer = melanoma. Sounds like pigmented BCC, but USMLE wants melanoma for this description.

Woman gets toxoplasmosis but cats isn’t listed as an answer; where did she get it from? à answer =
pork; can also be written as just simply “delicatessen meats”; both answers on offline NBMEs.

-

Biostats Q asks about what increasing the # of participants in a study would result in; answer =
decreased standard error of the mean; SEM = SD / (square root of the # of samples); so if samples
increase, then the denominator increases, and SEM decreases. Increasing # of samples will also
increase power and decrease beta error (false-negative error).

-

50F + weight loss + progressive shortness of breath + CXR shows pleural-based mass encasing the
lungs; what kind of cells are this patient’s malignant cells derived from? à answer = mesothelial cells;
mesothelioma will classically present with pleural and/or supradiaphragmatic plaques; if shown a
gross specimen, mesothelioma will appear to surround the lungs circumferentially, rather than
appearing as an isolated mass.

-

30F + last menstrual period 8 weeks ago + USS shows no obvious fetus or gestational sac + curettage
shows trophoblastic proliferation; what will chromosomal analysis of this tissue show? à answer =
46XX; Dx = complete mole; empty egg fertilized by one sperm that then duplicates (i.e., genetic
material is only of paternal origin); complete mole has no fetal parts; partial mole carries 67
chromosomal karyotype à one egg fertilized by two sperm; fetal parts present on USS.

-

Pic is shown of cavitating lung cancer; what’s the diagnosis? à answer = squamous cell carcinoma;
can present with cavitary/cavitating lesion.

-

35F + menorrhagia + deep/hoarse voice + delayed tendon reflexes + large, globular heart with
crackles at lung bases + low Hct + low MCV; next best step? à answer = check serum TSH; patient
likely has Hashimoto (hypothyroidism); can cause menorrhagia, reduced reflexes, and
cardiomyopathy. Anemia in this case is likely IDA due to heavy periods (although anemia of chronic
disease does indeed present with low MCV on many NBME Qs); other HY findings for hypothyroidism
are hypothyroid myopathy (­ serum CK), ­ LDL cholesterol, ­ hepatic transaminases, and low mood;
findings such as constipation, cold intolerance, brittle hair, and doughy skin are often omitted from
Qs because they’re too easy.

Biostats Q where researchers conclude there’s no increased risk of cancer in one study group vs
another, with a p value of 0.02; what does this p value indicate? à answer = probability of accepting
the null hypothesis when it’s false. This study concluded that there was no difference between the
groups, so they are saying there’s a 2% chance they fucked up, where there really was a difference
but they just didn’t catch it (i.e., beta error, or false-negative error); a p value given for a study
conclusion, in general, = the chance your conclusion is wrong; so if you get another biostats Q where
they say, yes, there was a difference between two drugs, with p value of 0.01, the interpretation is:
there’s a 1% chance we fucked up and there really was no difference between these drugs (i.e., a 1%
chance we rejected the null hypothesis when it was true).

-

Study finds high sugar consumption causes prostate cancer, with p value of 0.07; what does this p
value indicate the probability of? à answer = chance of rejecting a true null hypothesis. In other
words, a true null hypothesis means there really is no increased risk of prostate cancer caused by
sugar. But because the study said there’s a difference, they rejected the null hypothesis. And the p
value of 0.07 means they’re saying there’s a 7% chance they acknowledge they fucked up, where they
said there was increased risk of cancer even though in truth there isn’t.

-

Q asks which of the following agents is an NMDA receptor antagonist; answer = ketamine; NMDA
receptors are a type of glutamate receptor; ketamine is an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist.

-

Q asks which of the following will occur as a result of giving bortezomib; answer = decreased
activation of CD8+ T cells; bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that causes decreased MHC I
expression.

-

25M + motorcycle accident + now cannot dorsiflex left foot but eversion intact; Q asks which nerve is
fucked up; answer = deep peroneal (fibular) nerve; deep does dorsiflexion and sensation of the
webbing between the first and second toes; superficial peroneal (fibular) nerve does eversion +
sensation over most of the dorsum of the foot; common peroneal nerve injury would result in both
loss of dorsiflexion and eversion; tibial nerve injury results in loss of plantar flexion and sensation over
sole of the foot.

-

21F + vesicular, painful rash across left flank + pic shows you multinucleated giant cells; what’s the
most likely pathogen this patient should be screened for? à answer = HIV; only answer listed that

makes sense, as VZV not listed; young patient with shingles (herpes zoster; VZV); immunosuppression
in young patient resulting in shingles could reflect HIV infection.
-

25M + 3-day Hx of paresthesias of the legs + difficulty swallowing + diminished tendon reflexes + CSF
shows protein of 70 mg/dL and cell count of 5/uL; what’s the mechanism for this patient’s condition?
à answer = “destruction of myelin and endoneurial lymphocytic infiltrates”; USMLE wants you to
know this description of Guillain-Barre; CSF findings are albuminocytologic dissociation (increased
protein but normal cells).

-

Q asks for which type of receptor agonism is associated with pain and itching; answer = H1 agonism;
second generation H1 blockers such as loratadine can be used for anti-allergy effects; first generation
agents such as diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine have strong anti-cholinergic side-effects and
can actually be used, for this reason, as treatment for acute dystonia and motion sickness.

-

30M + sensory nerve injury in bar fight; Q asks what’s the rate-limiting step in reestablishing normal
sensation in this patient; answer = slow anterograde axonal transport; Wallerian degeneration results
in breakdown of axonal skeleton and myelin sheath distal to site of nerve injury; nerve regrows
anterograde from site of lesion at 1mm/day; slow anterograde transport / regeneration of nerve
becomes rate-limiting factor in restoration of function.

-

25M + rash on palms and soles + receives antibiotic Tx with drug he has received in the past; following
current Tx, now has fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea; what’s the most likely diagnosis? à answer =
Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction; answer can also be written as “reaction to lysis of spirochetes”; patient
has secondary syphilis (Treponema pallidum), as indicated by the palms/soles rash; Tx is with
penicillin G; lysis of spirochetes can cause anaphylaxis-like immune response known as J-H reaction.

-

30F + rheumatoid arthritis + currently being managed with infliximab but has not improved; Q asks
for which immune mediator is most likely contributing to symptoms; answer = IL-1. Infliximab is a
monoclonal antibody against soluble TNFa (not TNFa receptor); even though TNFa plays a role in
rheumatoid arthritis, we know TNFa is not the answer here because the patient is already on a med
for it; IL-1 and IL-6 are cytokines known to cause inflammation in RA; tocilizumab is a monoclonal
antibody against IL-6 receptor that can be used for advanced RA.
o

Normal Tx for RA is two-armed: symptoms and DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic
drugs).

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 12

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
o

For Sx: USMLE wants NSAIDs followed by steroids; these do not slow disease progression.

o

For slowing disease progression, the first-line DMARD is almost always methotrexate. If this
fails or patient has contraindications to it (i.e., pulmonary or hepatic disease), use an antiTNFa drug.

-

Simple Q asking the function of Sertoli cells; answer = produces aromatase.
o

Sertoli cells are stimulated by FSH and produce androgen-binding protein, aromatase, and
inhibin. Anti-Mullerian factor is also made by Sertoli cells in fetus.

o

Leydig cells are stimulated by LH and produce androgens.

o

The androgens produced by Leydig cells are converted to estrogens by the aromatase
produced by Sertoli cells.

o

Androgen-binding protein binds testosterone locally and keeps concentrations high in the
seminiferous tubules, enabling spermatogenesis. Do not confuse ABP with sex-hormonebinding globulin, which is produced by the liver and binds androgens and estrogens for
transport around the blood.

o

Leydig cells in males = theca interna cells in females.

o

Sertoli cells in males = granulosa cells in females.

o

Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (seen in females as well, despite the name) produces androgens à
leads to hirsutism/virilization; can also cause gynecomastia because ­ androgens can be
aromatized to estrogens.

o

Granulosa cell tumors classically present on USMLE as endometrial hyperplasia due to
unopposed / higher estrogen levels à can cause endometrial cancer (bleeding per vaginum).

-

20M + both common carotids are compressed externally for 10 seconds; what effect will this have on
alveolar ventilation, venous tone, arterial tone, and blood pressure; answer = all are ­.
o

If blood flow is ¯ to the carotid sinus (area just superior to bifurcation of common carotid
bilaterally) à ¯ stretch of baroreceptors à ¯ CN IX (glossopharyngeal) afferent firing to
solitary nucleus of medulla (not ­ firing, because the rate of firing is stretch-dependent) à ¯
efferent CN X (vagus; parasympathetic) + ­ efferent sympathetic firing to cardiac nodal
tissue à ­ heart rate.

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 13

­ sympathetic efferent firing also causes ­ arteriolar and venous vasoconstriction via a1
agonism (­ SVR à ­ BP) + ­ bronchodilation and respiratory rate via b2 agonism.

-

39M + bilateral renal enlargement + high blood pressure + father died from subarachnoid
hemorrhage; this patient most likely has a gene mutation in which protein? à answer = polycystin;
diagnosis is ADPKD; high blood pressure is from cysts impinging on the renal microvasculature leading
to surges in RAAS.

-

52M + 3-month-Hx of burning in esophagus + Hx of diabetes + ¯ pin-prick discrimination up to ankles
+ HbA1c of 9.6%; what’s the MOA of the most appropriate pharmacologic therapy? à answer =
antagonism of D2 receptors; drug is metoclopramide; Dx is diabetic gastroparesis; metoclopramide is
both a pro-kinetic and anti-emetic.
o

In contrast, if vignette is simply 42M + GERD-like presentation + no mention of poor diabetic
control, answer is “trial of PPIs” or “trial of H2 blockers” (I’ve seen both as correct answers,
but if you’re forced to choose between the two, always choose PPIs) for GERD.

-

30F + cuts finger on paper; moments after the cut, the bleeding stops; which of the following is the
mechanism for the quick cessation of blood loss? à answer = localized secretion of endothelin;
sounds slightly unusual, as endothelin is notably increased in pulmonary vascular resistance, but it
acts peripherally as well.
o

Endothelin is ­ in pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and congestive heart failure
(including isolated left heart failure); essentially any cause of increased pulmonary pressure
leads to ­ compensatory endothelin release (to restrict the increased blood flow).

-

28M + renal failure + hematuria + hearing loss; what’s the mechanism for this patient’s disease? à
answer = mutation in type IV collagen (Alport syndrome, X-linked); wrong answer is antibodies
against type IV collagen (Goodpasture); Alport à hematuria in a male + ear and/or eye problem;
Goodpasture à male 20s-40s with hematuria and hemoptysis.

-

19F + alkaline urine + renal tract calculi; which organism is most likely responsible? à answer =

62F + high Hb + high WBCs + high platelets + pO2 93%; what combination of EPO and arterial O2
blood content is most likely in this patient? à answer = ¯ EPO + normal arterial O2 content; diagnosis
is polycythemia vera (JAK2 mutation), which is a bone marrow overproduction of the different cell
lines; the high primary RBC production by the bone marrow suppresses EPO production by the kidney;
WBCs and/or platelets will also be increased. In contrast, in secondary polycythemia caused by lung
disease (­ EPO due to ¯ O2) or renal cell carcinoma (­ EPO production by cancer), only RBCs are high.
High hemoglobin (>17.5 g/dL) is seen + Hb-O2 saturation that is at the lower end of normal (93% is
minimally acceptable); arterial O2 content = pO2 (dissolved O2) + Hb-O2 (amount bound to Hb); since
Hb is high, less is saturated, but the amount of O2 in the blood (content) is still the same because
there is no lung disease, and Hb can still bind O2 without a problem. Tx for polycythemia vera is serial
phlebotomy.

What is the role of IkB in relation to NFkB? à answer = “releases NFkB after undergoing
phosphorylation”; USMLE also wants you to know that corticosteroids ¯ NFkB signaling in leukocytes.

-

Newborn + chorioretinitis + cataracts + microcephaly + no other info; Dx in the neonate? à answer =
CMV; congenital Toxo always = triad of chorioretinitis + hydrocephalus + intracranial calcifications; so
if you do not get this exact latter triad, you can eliminate congenital Toxo. Congenital CMV tends to
have a mix of non-specific findings, e.g., deafness, chorioretinitis, intracranial calcifications.
Congenital rubella will have PDA; congenital syphilis will have tooth abnormalities (Hutchinson), and
often saddle nose and/or Saber shins. Congenital VZV will have zig-zag skin lesions, limb
abnormalities, and microphthalmia.

-

14M + temp 103F + WBCs 25,000 with neutrophil shift; what’s the mechanism for the high leukocytes
in this patient’s blood? à answer = accelerated release of leukocytes from bone marrow postmitotic
reserve pool; diagnosis is leukemoid reaction, which means leukocytosis in the setting of infection;
leukocyte ALP is high; smear can show neutrophilia (i.e., a smear showing just, e.g., 8 neutrophils).

-

Q asks what the anticodon sequence of tRNA does; answer = selection of specific mRNA for ribosomal
binding; tRNA anticodon is a 5’à3’ sequence that is complimentary to the codons of mRNA; when a
codon of an mRNA codes for a specific amino acid, this is because a corresponding (and
complimentary) tRNA binds to it via its anticodon site. The tRNA has an amino acid bound at its

acceptor stem. The tRNAs then transfer amino acids to the growing peptide strand at the ribosomes
during protein synthesis.
-

15M + skiing accident + tachycardia + tachypnea + BP 98/72 + decreased breath sounds on right + CXR
shows decreased lung markings on one side and large, black pleural space; Dx? à answer = tension
pneumothorax; blood pressure can be low or low-normal; tension pneumothorax is a pneumothorax
in which hemodynamic decompensation occurs (i.e., low BP); in this patient, although BP is
technically low-normal, this is only because the HR is increased to compensate, and the patient will
likely continue to decompensate. Mechanism for low BP in tension pneumothorax is compression of
venous structures returning blood to right atrium; Q need not mention contralateral tracheal
deviation; breath sounds will be decreased on affected side because air does not move in and out
through the pleural space; Tx is needle decompression followed by chest tube connected to
underwater apparatus.

-

36M + stab wound to chest + low BP + JVD + systolic BP drops 12 mmHg on inspiration; Dx? à answer
= cardiac tamponade; Beck triad for cardiac tamponade = hypotension, JVD, muffled heart sounds; Q
need not mention all three. Pulsus paradoxus, with drop of systolic BP >10 mmHg with inspiration is
classically seen in tamponade; tamponade is simply a pericardial effusion + hemodynamic
decompensation (i.e., low BP, or low-normal BP with high HR to compensate); ECG shows electrical
alternans (alternating QRS amplitudes due to blood moving within the pericardial sac, causing
fluctuation in distance between the leads); ECG will show same finding in simple pericardial effusion
that is not tamponade; Tx is echo to confirm followed by pericardiocentesis or pericardial window.
Factor that is most important for tamponade development is acuteness of blood accumulation, not
volume – i.e., stab wound, or LV free-wall rupture post-MI, can lead to small volume of blood
accumulating quickly in pericardial sac, leading to tamponade, whereas, e.g., lymphatic obstruction
from lymphoma could cause slow-accumulating, high-volume chylous effusion over many months
that does not cause tamponade.
o

Hemothorax is contrasted with tamponade in that in the former, there are flattened neck
veins, whereas in tamponade, there’s JVD. This is how to distinguish if they don’t mention
the CXR or decreased unilateral breath sounds for hemothorax.

42F + in hospital for surgery two days ago + shortness of breath + HR 92 + ECG shows no
abnormalities; the medication she needs has what MOA? à answer = activation of anti-thrombin;
heparin is drug given; diagnosis is pulmonary embolism; sinus tachycardia is most common finding on
ECG (normal ECG + ­ HR = sinus tachycardia); after heparin, do spiral CT of chest for diagnosis; do V/Q
scan first in pregnant women.

-

29M + lancinating/stabbing pain in cheek lasting several seconds + happens spontaneously; Q asks
location of problem; answer = pons; unusual answer, since trigeminal neuralgia is a peripheral
mechanism, but CN V comes from pons; answer can also be “microvascular compression of CN V”; no
acute Tx since the Sx subside so quickly; prophylaxis is carbamazepine.
o

Do not confuse trigeminal neuralgia of the V1 distribution with cluster headache; the latter
will occur usually during sleep and will last up to half hour; details such as lacrimation and
rhinorrhea are HY but too easy and often omitted from Qs; Q can mention pupillary changes
during cluster headache; Tx = 100% oxygen; prophylaxis is verapamil (not propranolol).

o

Migraine prophylaxis on USMLE = propranolol (sometimes just written as beta blockade); Tx
is NSAIDs followed by triptans (serotonin receptor agonists).

-

23F + relaxing after coming back from a run; which of the following describes her changes in diastole
and systole as her heart rate returns to normal? à answer = diastole increases more than systole; the
Q can also be asked as the inverse: that is, as HR increases, diastole shortens more than systole; the
learning point is that the slower the heart rate, the greater the proportion of time spent in diastole.

-

40F + goes for run; which of the following regarding diastole and systole represent her coronary
artery filling pressure at rest vs while running? à answer = at rest: diastole > systole; while running:
diastole > systole; answer is the same for both; the coronary arteries fill during diastole irrespective of
how fast the HR is.

-

50M + severe upper back pain + 3/6 holo-diastolic murmur loudest after S2; Dx? à answer = aortic
dissection; classically pain radiating back between the scapulae; retrograde propagation of the
dissection can cause aortic root dilation with aortic regurgitation (decrescendo holo-diastolic
murmur); CXR shows widening of the mediastinum; give labetalol to decrease shearing forces;

answer = costochondritis; even though it doesn’t change with position, it worsens with palpation.

-

53M + recent surgery + in hospital; Q asks for what post-surgical finding is most likely to reflect good
recovery; answer = brisk diuresis; USMLE wants you to know that diuresis (urination) is a good sign of
post-operative recovery. This is also the case in patients who have renal insufficiency who are being
managed – i.e., brisk diuresis indicates recovery from the renal pathology.

-

40M + history of alcoholism + serum potassium of 3.2; following K+ administration, potassium
remains at 3.2; why? à answer = hypomagnesemia; low Ca2+ and K+ non-responsive to
supplementation à answer = check serum magnesium; Mg2+ required for basal level PTH secretion
(¯ Mg à ¯ Ca); Mg2+ also inhibits a K+ secretory pump in the distal kidney (¯ Mg à ­ K wasting);
alcoholics are classic group at risk of hypomagnesemia due to mere dietary deficiency (EtOH is
7kcal/g, so they fill up on alcohol).

-

18M + gets lost hiking in woods for 3 weeks + BMI 27; what electrolyte are we worried about upon

NBME).

-

40F + found in street with hypothermia + rewarmed in hospital + picture is shown of her feet and

bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, excitation of skeletal muscle, lacrimation, salivation, sweating; so
TCAs can cause constipation, urinary retention, mydriasis, tachycardia, bronchodilation (in theory, but
this is more sympathetic beta-2-mediated, rather than anti-muscarinic), relaxation of skeletal muscle
tone, dry eyes, dry mouth, anhidrosis (leading to heat retention and red, hot patient).

-

30F + going on a plane + receives diphenhydramine to prevent motion sickness; what receptor is
responsible for anti-motion sickness in this patient? à answer = anti-muscarinic; diphenhydramine
and chlorpheniramine are first-generation H1-blockers with nasty anti-cholinergic side-effects;
muscarinic receptor blockade ameliorates feelings of motion sickness; H1 will not be listed as an
answer in this case, so choose muscarinic; H2 might be listed, but diphenhydramine and
chlorpheniramine don’t act on H2.

-

24M + cuts his arm while scraping the BBQ in the backyard; which cell infiltrating into the area of the
wound in the acute setting will most likely decrease his risk of a bacterial infection? à answer =
neutrophils; present in acute inflammation; part of innate immunity; phagocytose and kill bacteria via
lysosomal hydrolases and H2O2 production.

-

55M + hyperthyroidism + pulses absent in left lower extremity; Dx? à answer = arterial embolic
occlusion; acute limb ischemia in this case is caused by left atrial mural thrombus, secondary to
hyperthyroidism-induced atrial fibrillation, launching off to the femoral artery; absence of pulses
indicates arterial occlusion; in contrast, in DVT, pulses are normal, since the arteries are fine; AF can
also lead to clot launching off to brain (stroke) or SMA/IMA (acute mesenteric ischemia).

-

80M + atrial fibrillation + severe abdominal pain + physical exam shows mild tenderness to palpation;
Dx? à answer = acute mesenteric ischemia; pain out of proportion to physical exam is characteristic;
left atrial mural thrombus from AF launched off to SMA or IMA.

-

65M + diabetes + Hx of CABG + intermittent claudication + pain in abdomen 1-2 hours after meals;
most likely cause of abdominal pain? à answer = atherosclerosis; Dx is chronic mesenteric ischemia;

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 20

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
presentation will sound like duodenal ulcer (pain 1-2 hours after meals) but in patient who has severe
cardiovascular Hx. H. pylori causing duodenal ulcer, in contrast, will be a younger immigrant patient
usually.
-

30M + rheumatoid arthritis + overdosed on methotrexate in suicide attempt + now has massive
hepatonecrosis; the liver can regenerate via which of the following cellular mechanisms? à answer =
recruitment of cells from G0 into cell cycle; when there is hepatocellular damage, remaining cells in
G0 (quiescent phase) will enter G1 of the cell cycle and begin replication; the wrong answer is stem
cells entering G1 of cell cycle; this is because stem cells aren’t activated into G1; it is merely the case
that other hepatocytes exist in G0, not undergoing replication, and are then stimulated into G1 for
replication.

-

500 factory workers are surveyed to determine whether they smoke or not and whether they have
COPD or not; what kind of study design is this? à answer = cross-sectional survey; this is merely a
snapshot of a population at one point in time; a survey group is called up, and then numbers of
smokers vs non-smokers, and disease vs no disease, can be assessed. This determines prevalence of
disease but not causation. This is different from case-control, where the initial study design is not that
of calling up people and asking all of this info at once; instead, case-control entails taking two distinct
groups – one with COPD vs one without COPD, and then asking about their smoking history to
attempt demonstrate causation.

-

20F + insulinoma; Q asks about C-peptide, insulin, and serum ketone levels; answer = ­ C-peptide, ­
insulin, ¯ ketones. C-peptide is a cleavage protein during the production of endogenous insulin, so if
endogenous insulin is produced (i.e., via insulinoma), then C-peptide should be proportionally high.
Ketogenesis is inhibited by insulin, so ketones must be low. Ketone production requires fatty acid
breakdown into acetyl-CoAs as the starting blocks; beta-oxidation is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, which
is an intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, as stimulated by insulin.
o

A tangential HY point is that DKA is not seen in type II diabetes because insulin is high
initially; DKA is only seen in type I, since insulin is deficient. If a USMLE Q gives you acute
type II diabetes and asks what’s high in the patient’s serum, the wrong answer is ketones;
the correct answer is insulin (hyperinsulinemia due to insulin resistance).

-

2M + anemia + erythroblasts containing ferritin granules + enzyme analysis shows decreased deltaaminolevulinic acid synthase; administration of which vitamin might help this patient’s condition? à
answer = B6; diagnosis is X-linked sideroblastic anemia; first step of heme synthesis is succinyl-CoA +
glycine, via delta-ALA synthase and vitamin B6, becomes delta-aminolevulinic acid; sideroblastic
anemia is due to failure to synthesize delta-ALA and can be X-linked or classically caused by alcohol.
Prussian blue staining of ringed sideroblasts is classic à iron cannot be incorporated into heme and
remains within the RBC precursor around the mitochondria in a ring-distribution.
o

USMLE likes the heme synthesis disorders:
§

Acute intermittent porphyria à autosomal dominant; deficiency of porphobilinogen
deaminase; buildup of porphobilinogen; Sx are abdominal pain, red urine,
neuropathy. Tx w/ glucose and hematin can help.

§

Porphyria cutanea tarda à autosomal dominant; deficiency or uroporphobilinogen
decarboxylase; buildup of uroporphyrins and coproporphyrins; Sx are
photosensitivity and tea-colored urine.

-

62F + flank mass + serum calcium of 11.5 mg/dL + hemoglobin of 18.5 g/dL; diagnosis? à answer =
paraneoplastic syndrome; renal cell carcinoma can produce PTHrp (correct, similar to SCC of the lung)
and EPO (causing high hemoglobin). USMLE might give you a vignette of a smoker who has
hypercalcemia and polycythemia + show you a histologic specimen of many clear cells; clear cell
carcinoma is the most common variant of RCC; USMLE likes you to know histo for RCC is clear cells.
RCC can classically present with flank pain. Wilms tumor in a kid is painless flank mass.

-

Neonate born at 28 weeks gestation + difficulty breathing; what is deficient in this patient? à answer
= lamellar bodies; lamellar bodies are specialized organelles within type II pneumocytes that produce
surfactant; dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (lecithin) / sphingomyelin ratio should be >2.0-2.4 for
NRDS probability to be substantially decreased; elastic recoil is increased in NRDS due to lack of
surfactant; surfactant normally prevents the hydrostatic forces of the alveoli from causing collapse.

-

30F + pancreatitis + ARDS; following complete resolution of the ARDS, what is most likely to be
increased in this patient’s lungs? à answer = surfactant protein D (marker of lung injury); weird, but
know it because it’s on Step 1 NBME.

HY USMLE Review – Part III
-

72F + radical mastectomy 25 years ago + hard, raised purple lesions above the elbow; Dx? à
lymphangiosarcoma (Stewart-Treves syndrome) à you don’t have to agree that it’s HY, but it’s asked
on the NBME à caused by chronic lymphatic insufficiency classically years after radical mastectomy.

-

Neonate + spongy 1-cm red lesion on the chest; Dx? à strawberry hemangioma

-

Strawberry hemangioma Tx? à don’t treat; will grow slightly then regress spontaneously over a few
years

-

Neonate + large vascular lesion on the leg + thrombocytopenia; Dx? à Kasabach-Merritt syndrome
(aka hemangioma with thrombocytopenia) à this is on the pediatric 2CK forms three times asked in
different ways; students always say wtf and I have to explain that, yes, it’s weird, but it’s HY for some
magical reason; this is not a strawberry hemangioma and requires surgical Tx.

-

Neonate + large vascular lesion on the leg + thrombocytopenia; what is the cause of the
thrombocytopenia? à answer = “platelet sequestration.” I’ve memorized this from the NBMEs à
similar to splenomegaly, which can cause thrombocytopenia from sequestration within the red pulp,
the implication that the large vascular lesion of KMS is that platelets simply get caught within it.

-

“Cherry red blood/lips” à CO poisoning

-

“Brown blood” or “chocolate blood” à methemoglobinemia

-

Kid with brown blood and they ask you the mechanism (answers are “upregulation of anti-proteinase
2” or “deficiency of cytochrome reductase B5”) à answer = deficiency of cytochrome reductase B5;
this is on the USMLE. I’m not fucking with you. And if you Wiki it, you’ll see clear as day that they talk
about congenital methemoglobinemia due to deficiency of cytochrome reductase B5.

-

22M + violaceous papules in a temporal distrubtion à answer = Sturge-Weber syndrome; student
says “wtf? I thought that was associated with Port wine stain birthmark.” Yeah, if we take a trip back
to kindergarten, but you need to know it can present as cutaneous papules in a trigeminal nerve
distribution.

-

44M alcoholic + winter + they show a pic of his feet and they’re red; what electrolyte are we most
worried about upon rewarming them à answer = hyperkalemia à alcoholics are notably susceptible
to rhabo (ultra HY on the USMLE) à rhabdo causes myoglobin release, which is nephrotoxic and can
cause acute tubular necrosis (potassium goes up); even if the patient doesn’t get full-blown rhabdo

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

3

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
with ATN, reperfusion injury can cause O2 radical-mediated damage that induces cell lysis (increases
K levels).
-

14M + ataxia + cognitive decline over a few months à answer = glue, not alcohol à no way a kid that
young would get alcoholic cerebellar ataxia; this is on the NBME even if you find it stupid/weird.

-

16M found unconscious on floor in school bathroom + normal vitals + no eye findings + a little
sluggish à answer = butane (inhalant) toxicity à caused by “dusters” / inhaling computer cleaner;
this is on the USMLE!!!

-

Medial malleolus ulcer + hyperpigmentation of lower legs; Dx? à chronic venous insufficiency

-

Punched-out ulcer on foot + intermittent claudication; Dx? à arterial insufficiency (peripheral
vascular disease)

-

What causes venous insufficiency? à valvular incompetence (most commonly familial), resulting in
venous reflux + insufficiency.

-

What causes arterial insufficiency à atherosclerosis (diabetes, followed by smoking, are the two
most acceleratory risk factors; hypertension is the most common risk factor)

-

How do you Dx venous insufficiency? à duplex ultrasound of the calves showing stasis and/or
occlusive disease (the latter may result from venous insufficiency or cause it)

-

How do you Dx arterial insufficiency? à USMLE always wants ankle-brachial indices (ABI) first à
after this is done, the answer is Doppler ultrasound of the calves (duplex ultrasound is the answer for
venous) or arteriography; both of these latter answers are correct; they will not give you both; it will
be one or the other.

-

Tx for venous insufficiency à compression stockings

-

Tx for varicose veins à compression stockings

-

Varicose veins and venous insufficiency same thing? à varicose veins are one of the mere
presentations of venous insufficiency, so yes, patients with varicose veins have venous insufficiency.

-

47F has varicose veins + painful palpable cord by the ankle (is the treatment compression stockings or
subcutaneous enoxaparin; both are listed) à answer = subcutaneous enoxaparin because this is
superficial thrombophlebitis.

-

Tx for arterial insufficiency à exercise regimen first, THEN cilostazol (phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor)

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

4

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

What must you do before starting the exercise regimen in the Tx of arterial insufficiency à ECG stress
test to ascertain patient’s exercise tolerance.

-

What is patient has abnormal baseline ECG (e.g., BBB) à do echo stress test instead.

-

What if the patient can’t exercise à do dobutamine-echo stress test

-

What if the patient gets stable angina after merely walking up a flight of stairs à skip stress test and
go straight to myocardial perfusion scan (myocardial scintigraphic assay); this is answer on the NBME.

-

Patient has severe ischemia on stress test or myocardial perfusion scan à do coronary angiography
à then do coronary artery bypass grafting if three-vessel disease, OR two-vessel disease + diabetic,
OR single-vessel disease if it’s the left main coronary.

-

Patient with CVD is on various medications + has hyperkalemia; why? à ACEi, ARB, and
spironolactone all can cause hyperkalemia.

-

Patient with CVD is on various medications + hypokalemia; why? à furosemide (Loop diuretic)

-

When do we start patients on furosemide? à to fluid unload (dyspnea in heart failure or peripheral
edema)

-

Patient is started on furosemide + still has fluid overload; what’s the next diuretic to use à
spironolactone (this is really HY on the USMLE and is on Steps 1 and 2CK NBMEs) à essentially
furosemide causes increased K wasting, so we must give a potassium-sparing diuretic to balance the
effect (spironolactone).

-

What’s the MOA of spironolactone à aldosterone receptor antagonist.

-

Side-effects of spironolactone à hyperkalemia; gynecomastia.

-

When do we give patients spironolactone apart from as a step-up from Loops? à added onto heart
failure management after a patient is already on ACEi (or ARB) + beta-blocker. In other words, for
heart failure: give ACEi (or ARB) first, then add beta-blocker, then add spironolactone.

-

Major side-effects of beta-blockers à depression + sexual dysfunction (avoid in these patients)

-

Major side-effect of naproxen à fluid retention (edema) due to increased renal retention of sodium.

-

What is naproxen? à NSAID that the USMLE is obsessed with for some reason.

-

Why might NSAIDs cause fluid retention / renal retention of sodium? à knocking out COX à
decreased prostaglandin synthesis à decreased renal afferent arteriolar dilatation à decreased

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

5

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
renal blood flow à PCT of kidney compensates for perceived low blood volume by increasing Na
reabsorption à water follows sodium à edema.
-

BUN/Cr ratio in someone with NSAID-induced interstitial nephropathy à >20 (pre-renal).

-

What kind of vignette is a patient classically on naproxen? à osteoarthritis (OA).

-

How do we treat OA? à weight loss (biggest risk factor is obesity), then acetaminophen, then NSAIDs
à sometimes USMLE will mention naproxen being taken by OA patient to illustrate this common
scenario of poor self-management à acetaminophen recommended before NSAIDs because the
renal damage caused by NSAID use.

-

What are the four beta-blockers that decrease mortality in heart failure? à Metoprolol XR (extended
release) + carvedilol + nebivolol + bisoprolol à USMLE will never ask “extended-release”; they’ll just
want metoprolol, but cardiologists will spasm out if you say regular metoprolol without specifying
extended release; the idea being: we don’t give drugs like propranolol, atenolol, etc., for heart failure
because they don’t improve mortality.

-

When do we use “regular” metoprolol à classically first-line for atrial fibrillation rate control.

-

When do we use atenolol à stage-fright

-

When do we use propranolol à migraine prophylaxis, tachycardia in hyperthyroidism (decreases
peripheral conversion of T4 to T3), esophageal varices prophylaxis, akathisia caused by antipsychotics, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to increase preload (HOCM and MVP are the two murmurs
that get worse with low preload), essential tremor (AD familial tremor; patients self-medicate with
alcohol, which decreases tremor; but propranolol can also be used for other tremors; social phobia
(different from stage-fright).

-

Patient takes medication for muscle pain relief + gets wheezing (which should be avoided,
acetaminophen or aspirin; both are listed) à answer = aspirin (aspirin-induced asthma)

-

27F + intermittent headaches + blurry vision; Dx? à optic neuritis (multiple sclerosis) à student says
“why the headaches?” Yeah, I know. Weird. But it’s on the NBME. You need to know optic neuritis is
HY in MS and means inflammation of cranial nerve II à presents as blurry vision, or change in color
vision, or Marcus Gunn pupil (relative afferent pupillary defect)

-

Most specific eye finding in MS à medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) syndrome à aka internuclear
ophthalmoplegia (INO) à when you abduct to one side, you activate CN VI on that side, which

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

6

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
requires the contralateral CN III to activate in order to adduct à the side that cannot adduct is the
side that’s fucked up; the normal side will have nystagmus.
-

Tx for acute flare of MS à IV steroids (oral is wrong and can make flares worse).

-

Tx between flares of MS (the patient must by asymptomatic) à IFN-beta (interferon beta).

-

Tx for spasticity in MS à baclofen.

-

MOA of baclofen à GABA-B receptor agonist (USMLE loves baclofen).

-

Dx of MS à choose MRI over CSF IgG oligoclonal bands if both are listed.

-

Urinary incontinence in MS à urge incontinence (hyperactive detrusor / detrusor instability)

-

65F + unilateral temporal headache + blurry vision; Dx? à temporal arteritis

-

Tx for TA à immediate IV methylprednisolone (IV steroids) to prevent blindness, then do temporal
artery biopsy; do not choose biopsy before steroids.

-

What other condition is TA associated with? à polymyalgia rheumatica (in fact, they’re considered to
be on the same disease spectrum, rather than as two inherently distinct conditions)

-

65F + unilateral temporal headache + muscle pain/stiffness à temporal arteritis + polymyalgia
rheumatica

-

Tx for PR if patient doesn’t also have temporal arteritis à oral steroids are okay bc not an emergency.

-

Polymyalgia rheumatica vs polymyositis à PR presents with stiffness/pain generally without
weakness; polymyositis can present with pain, but it also has proximal muscle weakness. Both
conditions can present with elevations of ESR and CRP, so these aren’t reliable for Dx.

-

Dx of PR à clinical; there’s no specific test.

-

Dx of polymyositis à same as with dermatomyositis, do anti-Jo1 and -Mi2 antibodies, then do
confirmatory muscle biopsy.

-

Oral + genital ulcers à Behcet syndrome

-

Violaceous rash around the eyelids à heliotrope rash à Dx = dermatomyositis (don’t confuse that
with malar rash of SLE).

-

Violaceous papules on knuckles + cracked/dry palms = dermatomyositis (Gottron papules +
mechanics’ hands).

-

Rash around back of neck + top of back + adult with proximal muscle weakness (difficulty standing
from chair unassisted) à shawl rash à dermatomyositis.

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

7

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

Dx of dermatomyositis à anti-Jo1 or -Mi2 antibodies first à muscle biopsy confirmatory.

-

Polymyositis = dermatomyositis but without the skin findings.

-

USMLE wants you to know that in dermatomyositis, there’s specifically an increased risk of what? à
malignancy (non-Hodgkin lymphoma) à that being said, autoimmune diseases in general increase the
risk of NHL à so if you have, e.g., patient with SLE with irregular ring-enhancing lesion on head CT,
answer = primary CNS lymphoma, not toxoplasmosis.

-

Tx for flare of polymyositis/dermatomyositis à oral corticosteroids.

-

Antibodies in pemphigus vulgaris? à anti-desmoglein (anti-desmosome) à desmosomes enable
adjacent cell-to-cell adhesion.

-

Antibodies in bullous pemphigoid à anti-hemidesmosome à hemidesmosomes secure the dermis to
the epidermal basal layer.

-

Which one is worse, bullous pemphigoid or pemphigus vulgaris? à pemphigus vulgaris; why? à PV
gets bullae on the skin that rupture with friction (Nikolsky sign) + scar à oral mucosal involvement is
more prevalent in PV.

-

What kind of immunofluorescence on biopsy in PV vs BV? à Linear in BV; net-like in PV.

-

What else is associated with linear immunofluorescence on the USMLE? à Goodpasture syndrome
(on biopsy of the kidney or alveoli).

-

Tx for PV and BV à oral corticosteroids

-

Mechanism for Goodpasture syndrome? à antibodies against type IV collagen à “2, 3, 4… 2, 3, 4… 2,
3, 4. The Goodpasture is marching in the field, 2, 3, 4!”à Type 2 hypersensitivity against the alpha-3
chains of type 4 collagen.

-

Hematuria + hemoptysis + “head-itis” (mastoiditis, sinusitis, otitis, nasal septal perforation) à
Wegener granulomatosis

-

Annoying new name for Wegener à granulomatosis with polyangiitis

-

Dx of Wegener à c-ANCA (anti-PR3; anti-proteinase 3)

-

Asthma + eosinophilia à Churg-Strauss

-

Annoying new name for CS à eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis

-

Dx of CS à p-ANCA (anti-MPO; anti-myeloperoxidase)

What is polyarteritis nodosa à medium-vessel vasculitis characterized by immune complex
deposition in vascular walls and fibrinoid necrosis

-

Polyarteritis nodosa is associated with what infection? à 30% of patients are HepB positive

What do you see on renal artery angiogram in PN à “beads on a string” (similar to fibromuscular
dysplasia, although completely unrelated diseases).

-

Which vessels are notably not affected in PN à pulmonary vessels (USMLE likes this detail).

-

Tx for PN à oral corticosteroids

-

32F + arthritis + mouth ulcer + low platelets; Dx? à SLE

-

Most common presentation finding in SLE à arthritis (>90%)

Woman 20s-40s + arthritis + thrombocytopenia à SLE

-

Woman 20s-40s + arthritis + mouth ulcer + circular skin lesions à SLE

peripheral destruction (antibodies against hematologic cells lines seen in SLE; isolated
thrombocytopenia most common)

-

Tx of SLE flare à steroids

-

SLE + red urine; Dx? à lupus nephritis, more specifically, diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis
(DPGN)

-

Histology of DPGN à wire looping capillary pattern

-

Tx of lupus nephritis à mycophenolate mofetil

-

Tx of discoid lupus à hydroxychloroquine

-

Most specific Abs for SLE à anti-Smith (RNP), not anti-dsDNA

-

Which Abs go up in acute SLE flares à anti-dsDNA (and C3 goes down)

Viral infection + all three cell-lines are down à viral-induced aplastic anemia

-

Viral-induced aplastic anemia; next best step in Dx? à bone marrow aspiration

-

Viral-induced aplastic anemia; mechanism? à defective bone marrow production (contrast with SLE)

-

80F has catheter; how to best decrease infection risk in this patient (all answers listed sound
reasonable) à correct answer = hand washing

-

17M has mononucleosis; how to best decrease risk of transmission? à answer = hand washing (“huh,
I thought it was just kissing + sharing cups n stuff.” I agree with you. But the USMLE wants
handwashing.

-

72M + intermittent claudication + absent distal pulses + Hx of coronary artery bypass grafting + high
BP that’s been gradually increasing past two years; Dx? à renal artery stenosis

-

32F + high BP + high aldosterone/renin à fibromuscular dysplasia (tunica media proliferation in renal
arteries) à this is not renal artery stenosis à if you say “renal artery stenosis,” that means
atherosclerosis.

-

Increased creatinine following medication administered to someone with renal artery stenosis; what
was the drug? à ACEi or ARB

-

Tx for RAS + FMD à initially medical therapy with cautious use of ACEi or ARB; definitive is renal
angioplasty + stenting; FMD is not curable.

-

Dx of malaria à thick + thin blood smears, not antibody titer for Plasmodium species

non-adherence or resistance to chloroquine? à answer = resistance to chloroquine

-

What is the MOA of chloroquine? à inhibits Plasmodium heme polymerase.

-

Which malaria type is the worst and why? à P. falciparum because it causes cerebral malaria.

-

Fever cycles and malaria? à P. vivax/ovale have fever every 48 hours; P. malariae every 72 hours; P.
falciparum causes sporadic/unpredictable fever.

-

Which drug is often given to people for malaria prophylaxis who go to chloroquine-resistant areas? à
mefloquine

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 10

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

Girl goes to Africa + gets malaria + she is then treated after the fact with atovoquine + proguanil and
the presentation subsides; then one month later she has malaria again; why? à answer = reactivation
of non-erythrocytic form of organism” à she has P. vivax or P. ovale à cause hypnozoites which are
an intra-hepatic form of the disease.

-

Question literally asks you point-blank why a patient is given primaquine à answer = “primaquine
kills hypnozoites” or “kills extra-erythrocytic forms.”

-

Why does sickle cell confer resistance to malaria à decreased RBC lifespan (malaria needs normal
RBC lifespan to complete life cycle)

-

Travel + bloody diarrhea + RUQ pain; Dx? à liver abscess due to Entamoeba histolytica

-

How do you Tx the liver abscess? à answer = percutaneous drainage BEFORE antibiotics

-

Abx for E. histolytica? à metronidazole + iodoquinol (latter kills intraluminal parasite); paromomycin
may also be given.

-

Watery diarrhea in immunocompromised patient à Cryptosporidium parvum

How is Giardia transmitted (is the answer “water-borne” or “fecal-oral”?); answer = water-borne

-

Steatorrhea in guy who went swimming or scuba diving à Giardia

-

Tx for Giardia à metronidazole

-

Fever + periorbital edema + muscle aches + went to a BBQ; Dx? à Trichinella spiralis à this is a
classic triad seen in trichinosis.

-

How do you get trichinosis? à bear meat (yes, Alaska is still in the United States and people hunt
polar bear) or pork (pork nematode, not cestode)

-

What is nematode vs cestode vs trematode? à nematode is roundworm; cestode tapeworm;
trematodes are flukes.

-

Nematode from pork à Trichinella spiralis

-

Cestode (tapeworm) from pork à Taenia solium

-

What does T. solium cause? à cysticersosis (muscle cysts) or neurocysticercosis (brain cysts)

-

“Swiss cheese appearance” of brain in someone who traveled abroad à neurocysticercosis

-

Single cystic lesion seen on brain CT in someone who went to Mexico à neurocysticercosis

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 11

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM
-

Tx for cysticersosis / neurocysticercosis à praziquantel or albendazole (the USMLE will never give you
both and make you choose between them; for anti-helminth drugs questions, the correct answer will
be the only anti-helminth drug listed).

-

Which helminth causes visceral larva migrans? à Toxicara canis

-

Worm in the eye? à Loa Loa

-

How do you get Loa Loa à deer, horse, or mango fly

-

HIV patient with lobar pneumonia (is the answer PJP or S. pnuemo?) à answer = Strep pneumo à
PJP presents as bilateral interstitial infiltrates + groundglass appearance on CXR; S. pneumo is lobar à
sort of a trick Q similar to asbestos (i.e., bronchogenic carcinoma still more likely than mesothelioma
in pt with Hx of asbestos exposure; well S. pneumo still more common than PJP in
immunocompromised pts). The key though is the lobar vs bilateral presentation as mentioned above.

-

Upper lobe nodular density in immunocompromised patient à Aspergilloma

-

Dx of Aspergilloma à open lung biopsy

-

13F with irregular periods; next best step in Mx? à reexamine in one year (reassurance) à periods
are typically abnormal in the first year following menarche

-

13F has never had a period + has suprapubic mass + nausea + vomiting; next best step in Mx? à
answer = do beta-hCG à she’s pregnant; this is HY. Correct, girls can get pregnant without ever
having had a period à must rule out.

-

14F has massive unilateral breast mass + mom is freaking out bc her sister died of breast cancer à
answer = follow-up in six months à virginal breast hypertrophy is normal during puberty.

-

15M has unilateral mass behind his nipple +/- tenderness of it à answer = reassurance à physiologic
gynecomastia of puberty (higher androgens are aromatized to estrogens).

-

Girl is Tanner stage 3; which of the following is true? à answer = menarche is imminent à USMLE
asks this Q straight up and it’s exceedingly HY and frequent.

So whether you agree with it or not because you think the time frame is too early, I don’t know what
to tell you, it’s the fucking answer on the NBME and everyone gets it wrong, including myself when I
answered it. One thing I might point out however is that they said in this Q that the girl had lethargy,
which I’ve noticed having gone thru different NBME Qs repeatedly as a tutor, can non-specifically
imply metabolic acidosis à in other words, I’ve seen various Qs on surg, IM, and peds forms, etc.,
where there will be, e.g., lactic acidosis, and they’ll mention lethargy. I have also seen lethargy in

step in Mx? à immediate IV broad-spectrum antibiotics à fever + low neutrophils = febrile
neutropenia, aka neutropenic fever; this is a medical emergency and means a patient has an
infection but no way to fight it off à I have seen plenty of students select “give platelets” as the
answer here, no idea why. It’s really rare to transfuse platelets, but may be considered with counts
under 10-20k if there is spontaneous bleeding. We also tend to transfuse RBCs if under 7 g/dL, but if
you get low neutrophils + fever in the same vignette, transfuse RBCs is wrong. I notice the “rule” of
transfusing RBCs if Hb is 7 g/dL or lower causes students to get Qs wrong; think of it as a general
propensity for transfusion, rather than as a mandatory answer for the Q.

AV-nicking on fundoscopy à answer = hypertensive retinopathy

-

Tx for hypertension? à if patient has pre-diabetes, diabetes, or any cardiovascular/cerebrovascular
disease of any kind à answer = ACEi or ARB first. These agents decrease morbidity and mortality in
these patient groups. If patient has none of the above (i.e., your typical fat American middle-age male
who’s a little overweight but otherwise just has essential hypertension), the answer = HCTZ or
dihydropyridine CCB. You might think that’s really weird (i.e., “why not just give an ACEi or ARB
anyway to anyone if they’re good for morbidity/mortality?”), but the basis is: you’re not going to live
to 120 just because you start taking a statin when it’s not indicated; well the same is true here:
there’s no evidence of further improvement or morbidity/mortality in pts without the above risk
factors if started on ACEi or ARB). This knowledge about how to Tx HTN is HY for FM shelves in
particular.

-

Why doesn’t amoxicillin or penicillin cover Staph? à Most community Staph (not MRSA; just MSSA)
produces beta-lactamase, so much give beta-lactamase-resistant beta-lactam (diclox and fluclox are

1. A group of epidemiologists and geneticists is studying the frequency of alleles A and a in
a population. They find that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The
frequency of the allele A is 0.12 and the frequency of the allele a is 0.88. Which of the
following represents the percentage of heterozygous individuals in this population:
a) 1.44%
b) 10.56%
c) 21.12%
d) 33.00%
e) 77.44%

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is c.
The Hardy-Weinberg equation is: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1.
The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that allele and genotype frequencies will remain
constant from one generation to the next in the absence of external influences. The two
alleles, A and a, have frequencies of p and q, respectively. For an AA genotype to occur, the
allele A needs to occur twice (each with the frequency of p). The frequency of an AA
genotype is, therefore, p * p or p^2, while the frequency of the aa genotype is q * q = q^2.
The other two outcomes are genotypes Aa and aA, represented by p * q and q * p,
respectively. Both of these represent heterozygotes for the trait in question so the frequency
of heterozygotes is p * q + q * p = p * q + p * q = 2pq. The sum of the frequencies of all the
possible genotypes is 1 (100% of the population has one of those genotypes). Also p + q = 1
because every locus will have either the allele A or the allele a so the sum of their
probabilities is 1. Note that Hardy-Weinberg equation also equals (p + q)^2.
In this case, p = 0.12 and q = 0.88.
Therefore, p^2 = 0.0144 = 1.44% is the AA frequency, q^2 = 0.7744 = 77.44% is the
frequency of aa, and 2 * 0.12 * 0.88 = 0.2112 = 21.12% is the frequency of Aa.

The correct answer is c.
The Hardy-Weinberg equation is: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1.
The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that allele and genotype frequencies will remain
constant from one generation to the next in the absence of external influences. The two
alleles, A and a, have frequencies of p and q, respectively. For an AA genotype to occur,
the allele A needs to occur twice (each with the frequency of p). The frequency of an AA
genotype is, therefore, p * p or p^2, while the frequency of the aa genotype is q * q =
q^2. The other two outcomes are genotypes Aa and aA, represented by p * q and q * p,
respectively. Both of these represent heterozygotes for the trait in question so the
frequency of heterozygotes is p * q + q * p = p * q + p * q = 2pq. The sum of the
frequencies of all the possible genotypes is 1 (100% of the population has one of those
genotypes).
In this case, 4% of the population is affected (homozygous for the recessive allele),
represented by q^2. We can easily calculate that if q^2 = 0.04 => q = 0.2.
Since p + q = 1, we can calculate that p = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
The recessive gene is not carried by those homozygous for the dominant gene,
represented by p^2, or 0.64 = 64%.
The unaffected carriers are represented by 2pq = 2 * 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.32 = 32%.

constant from one generation to the next in the absence of external influences. The two
alleles, A and a, have frequencies of p and q, respectively. For an AA genotype to occur,
the allele A needs to occur twice (each with the frequency of p). The frequency of an AA

respectively. Both of these represent heterozygotes for the trait in question so the
frequency of heterozygotes is p * q + q * p = p * q + p * q = 2pq. The sum of the
frequencies of all the possible genotypes is 1 (100% of the population has one of those
genotypes). Also p + q = 1 because every locus will have either the allele A or the allele a
so the sum of their probabilities is 1. Note that Hardy-Weinberg equation also equals (p +
q)^2.
The individuals heterozygous for the sickle cell gene are expected to have increased
resistance to malaria. According to the Hardy-Weinberg equation, 2pq represents
heterozygous individuals. 1% of the population has sickle cell anemia, meaning they are
homozygous (q^2).
If q^2 = 0.01, we can calculate that q = 0.1. Since p + q = 1; p = 0.9.
2pq = 2 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.18 = 18%.
18% of the population is heterozygous and likely has increased resistance to malaria. The
number of such individuals is 18% of 10,000, or 0.18 * 10,000 = 1,800.

c) 1/500

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 10

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is a.
The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that allele and genotype frequencies will remain
constant from one generation to the next in the absence of external influences. The two
alleles, A and a, have frequencies of p and q, respectively. For an AA genotype to occur,
the allele A needs to occur twice (each with the frequency of p). The frequency of an AA
genotype is, therefore, p * p or p^2, while the frequency of the aa genotype is q * q =
q^2. The other two outcomes are genotypes Aa and aA, represented by p * q and q * p,
respectively. Both of these represent heterozygotes for the trait in question so the
frequency of heterozygotes is p * q + q * p = p * q + p * q = 2pq. The sum of the
frequencies of all the possible genotypes is 1 (100% of the population has one of those
genotypes). Also p + q = 1 because every locus will have either the allele A or the allele a
so the sum of their probabilities is 1. Note that Hardy-Weinberg equation also equals (p +
q)^2.
Males only have a single X chromosome. Therefore, the incidence of the disease in the
male portion of the population is equivalent to the frequency of the gene in the
population. That differs from the autosomal recessive conditions where the probability
that one is a homozygote for the recessive allele is q^2, where q is the frequency of the
gene in the population. The frequency of an X-linked recessive disease in females is still
q^2 as females have two X chromosomes.

5. A group of epidemiologists is studying cystic fibrosis (CF) in a population in Europe. The

a) 1/3,600
b) 1/1,800
c) 1/60
d) 1/30
e) cannot be calculated

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 12

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is d.

The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that allele and genotype frequencies will remain
constant from one generation to the next in the absence of external influences. The two
alleles, A and a, have frequencies of p and q, respectively. For an AA genotype to occur,
the allele A needs to occur twice (each with the frequency of p). The frequency of an AA
genotype is, therefore, p * p or p^2, while the frequency of the aa genotype is q * q =
q^2. The other two outcomes are genotypes Aa and aA, represented by p * q and q * p,
respectively. Both of these represent heterozygotes for the trait in question so the
frequency of heterozygotes is p * q + q * p = p * q + p * q = 2pq. The sum of the
frequencies of all the possible genotypes is 1 (100% of the population has one of those
genotypes). Also p + q = 1 because every locus will have either the allele A or the allele a
so the sum of their probabilities is 1. Note that Hardy-Weinberg equation also equals (p +
q)^2.
Assuming the population is in a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of carriers is
2pq. Considering that the disease is rare and p is close to 1, we can simplify it to say that
the frequency of carriers is approximately 2q. Since the incidence of the disease is
1/3,600, it means that the frequency of people who are homozygous for the recessive
gene (or q^2) is 1/3,600. That means that q = 1/60. The frequency of carriers is, therefore,
2q = 2 * 1/60 = 1/30.
In X-linked recessive disorders, the incidence of the disease in males is approximately the
same as the frequency of the gene in question as males only have 1 X chromosome.

was determined to be 130/80 mmHg. The heart rate was 70 beats per minute. The end
systolic volume was found to be 45 mL, while the end diastolic volume was found to be
120 mL. Which of the following best represents the mean arterial pressure in this patient:
a) 105 mmHg
b) 120 mmHg
c) 97 mmHg
d) 130 mmHg
e) 80 mmHg

The correct answer is c.
The mean arterial pressure is calculated as: MAP = 2/3 diastolic + 1/3 systolic blood
pressure (due to relative lengths of systole and diastole - the diastole lasts approximately
twice as long as systole). 2/3 * 80 + 1/3 * 130 = 97. 130 is the systolic blood pressure and
80 is the diastolic blood pressure. If the relative lengths of systole and diastole were
equal, then the mean arterial pressure would be the mean of the two pressures (105
mmHg) but that is not the case.

7. A healthy 47-year-old man is undergoing echocardiography testing. It is determined that
his end-systolic volume was 50 mL and his end-diastolic volume was 120 mL. His heart
rate was 75 beats per minute and his blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. Which of the
following represents the stroke volume in this patient:
a) 50 mL
b) 70 mL
c) 120 mL
d) 3750 mL
e) 5250 mL

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 16

The correct answer is b.
The stroke volume (SV) is calculated as: end diastolic volume - end systolic volume and
represents the volume of blood that the heart pumps in each beat. The end diastolic
volume is the volume of blood in the heart at the end of diastole (once the filling of the
heart has finished). The systolic volume is the amount of blood that remains in the heart
at the end of systole (after expelling the SV of blood into the arterial system has finished).
Therefore EDV = SV + ESV. In this case it is 120 mL - 50 mL = 70 mL. The cardiac
output is the volume the heart pumps per minute. It is calculated as SV * HR (in this case
it is 5250 mL/min) as HR represents the number of times the stroke volume is pumped.

his heart rate is 77/min and his oxygen saturation rate is 96%. ECG reveals no significant
changes. An echocardiogram is performed. It is found that the end systolic volume in this
patient is 55 mL and the end diastolic volume is 125 mL. Which of the following
represents the ejection fraction in this patient:
a) 12%
b) 31%
c) 44%
d) 56%
e) 69%

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 18

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is d.
Ejection fraction represents the proportion of the end diastolic volume that the heart
pumps out in a beat (represented by stroke volume, SV). The stroke volume (SV) is the
volume of blood that the heart pumps in each beat. The end diastolic volume is the
volume of blood in the heart at the end of diastole (once the filling of the heart has
finished). The systolic volume is the amount of blood that remains in the heart at the end
of systole (after expelling of the blood into the arterial system has finished). One can also
look at this as follows: at the end of diastole, the volume of blood in the heart is the end
diastolic volume. The pumping out of the stroke volume is the systole and at the end of it,
the end systolic volume remains in the heart. Therefore EDV - SV = ESV. We can
calculate that the stroke volume in this patient is 70 mL (EDV - ESV). The ejection
fraction is then calculated as SV/EDV = 70/125 = 56%.

9. A 55-year-old male is taking part in a research study at the cardiology department. As
part of the study, he is undergoing a complete cardiac evaluation. His blood pressure was

following represents the total peripheral resistance in this patient:
a) 0.0208 mmHg/mL/min

c) 0.0208 mmHg/mL
d) 0.025 mmHg
e) cannot be calculated

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 20

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is a.
The basic physics of fluid mechanics can be applied to blood vessels as well. Remember
that pressure equals flow * resistance. Pressure in this case is the MAP, the flow (the
amount of blood that passes through) equals the cardiac output and the resistance is the
TPR.
Therefore, the total peripheral resistance is calculated from the following equation:
MAP = CO * TPR => TPR = MAP/CO.
The mean arterial pressure is calculated as: MAP = 2/3 diastolic + 1/3 systolic blood
pressure (due to relative lengths of systole and diastole - the diastole lasts approximately
twice as long as systole). The CO is the total amount of blood the heart pumps per minute
and equals the volume of blood pumped per beat times the number of beats per minute
(CO = SV * HR).
In this patient the MAP is 100 mmHg and the CO is SV * HR = (120 mL - 60 mL) *
80/min = 60 mL * 80/min = 4,800 mL/min. TPR = 100 mmHg/4,800 mL/min = 0.0208

a) 0.0087 mmHg/mL/min

c) 1.3 mmHg/mL
d) 0.882 mmHg/min
e) 0.882 mmHg/mL/min

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 22

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is b.
The pressure equals flow * resistance. Pressure in this case is the MAP, the flow (the
amount of blood that passes through) equals the cardiac output and the resistance is the
TPR.
Therefore, the total peripheral resistance is calculated from the following equation:
MAP = CO * TPR => TPR = MAP/CO.
MAP = 2/3 * diastolic pressure + 1/3 * systolic pressure = 2/3 * 60 mmHg + 1/3 * 105
mmHg = 75 mmHg.
Ejection fraction is the proportion of the end diastolic volume that the heart pumps out in
a beat (represented by SV). It is calculated as SV/EDV.
EF = SV/EDV => SV = EF * EDV = 0.4 * 170 mL = 68 mL.
The CO is the total amount of blood the heart pumps per minute and equals the volume of
blood pumped per beat times the number of beats per minute (CO = SV * HR).
CO = HR * SV = 85/min * 68 mL = 5780 mL/min.
TPR = MAP/CO = 75 mmHg/5780 mL/min = 0.013 mmHg/mL/min.

represents the cardiac output in this patient:
a) 125 mL/min

The correct answer is e.
The CO is the total amount of blood the heart pumps per minute and equals the volume of
blood pumped per beat times the number of beats per minute (CO = SV * HR). The
stroke volume (SV) is the volume of blood that the heart pumps in each beat and equals
the difference between the volume of blood at the end of diastole and the volume of blood
at the end of systole. Therefore EDV = SV + ESV.
Cardiac output is calculated as: CO = HR * SV = HR * (EDV - ESV).
In this case it is 80/min * (125 mL - 60 mL) = 80/min * 65 mL = 5,200 mL/min.

The end systolic volume was 65 mL and the end diastolic volume was 130 mL. His heart

c) 6175 mL/min
d) 23.40 mL O2
e) 6175 mL O2/min

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 26

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is a.
The CO is the amount of blood the heart pumps per minute and equals the volume of
blood pumped per beat times the number of beats per minute (CO = SV * HR). The
stroke volume represents the amount of blood that is pumped per beat and can be
calculated as the difference between the end diastolic volume and end systolic volume (as
the end systolic volume is the volume that is left once SV is ejected from EDV). Oxygen
consumption is the difference between the amount of oxygen leaving the lungs in the
pulmonary vein and the amount of oxygen entering the lungs in the pulmonary arteries
(the amount of oxygen that is consumed by the tissues). The amount of oxygen in the
pulmonary veins is the pulmonary blood flow multiplied by oxygen content of pulmonary
venous blood. The amount of oxygen in the pulmonary artery is pulmonary blood flow
multiplied by the oxygen content of pulmonary arterial blood. The pulmonary blood flow,
or the cardiac output of the right heart is equal to the cardiac output of the left heart.
Therefore, oxygen consumption can be calculated as:
O2 consumption = CO * O2 pulmonary vein - CO * O2 pulmonary artery.
Alternatively, we can calculate CO from this equation:
CO = O2 consumption / (Art. O2 content - Ven. O2 content), meaning that:
O2 consumption = CO * (Art. O2 content - Ven. O2 content).
CO can be calculated as:
CO = HR * (EDV-ESV) * (Art. O2 content - Ven. O2 content) = 95/min * (130 mL - 65
mL) * (0.18 mL O2/mL blood - 0.13 mL O2/mL blood) = 95/min * 65 mL * 0.05 mL
O2/mL blood = 308.75 mL O2/min.

14. 72-year-old female is evaluated for generalized edema. Her past medical history is

following is most likely associated with edema development in this patient:
a) increased oncotic pressure in the capillaries
b) increased hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries
c) increased hydrostatic pressure in the interstitium
d) decreased oncotic pressure in the interstitium
e) decreased hydraulic conductance

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 30

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is b.
This patient most likely suffers from congestive heart failure (CHF). As the ejection
fraction drops, the hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries rises as the heart is unable to
pump the blood that enters it. The fluid movement is explained by the following formula:
Jv = Kf * [(Pc - Pi) - (pi c - pi i)], where Kf is the hydraulic conductance, Pc and Pi are
the hydrostatic pressures in the capillaries and the interstitium, respectively; pi c and pi i
are the oncotic pressures in the capillaries and the interstitium, respectively. Elevated
hydrostatic pressure in the capillary and elevated oncotic pressure in the interstitium favor
the movement of fluid out of the capillaries, while elevated oncotic pressure in the
capillaries and elevated hydrostatic pressure in the interstitium favor the opposite. Fluid
moves from the area of the higher hydrostatic pressure towards the area with the lower
hydrostatic pressure and from the area of lower oncotic pressure to the area of higher
oncotic pressure. Also, by looking at the formula, we can see that increasing the capillary
hydrostatic pressure and decreasing the capillary oncotic pressure are the changes that
would lead to edema formation. Kf is a constant.

a) no net fluid movement
b) 3 mmHg favoring absorption
c) 3 mmHg favoring filtration
d) 5 mmHg favoring absorption
e) 5 mmHg favoring filtration

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 32

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is e.
The fluid movement is explained by the following formula:
Jv = Kf * [(Pc - Pi) - (pi c - pi i)], where Kf is the hydraulic conductance, Pc and Pi are
the hydrostatic pressures in the capillaries and the interstitium, respectively; pi c and pi i
are the oncotic pressures in the capillaries and the interstitium, respectively. Fluid
movement out of the capillary is favored by elevated hydrostatic and decreased oncotic
pressure within the capillary (and the opposite in the interstitium). Remember that fluids
always move from the areas with higher hydrostatic and lower oncotic pressures to the
areas with lower hydrostatic and higher oncotic pressures.
Higher Pc and pi i favor fluid filtration, while higher Pi and pi c favor fluid absorption.
Overall, that means that the 27 mmHg + 3 mmHg were favoring filtration, while 26
mmHg + (-1 mmHg) favored absorption. The difference is the net driving force. In this
case it is 30 mmHg - 25 mmHg = 5 mmHg, favoring fluid filtration.

The correct answer is c.
Renal clearance represents the rate at which a substance is removed from plasma. It can
be calculated as the ratio of the concentration of the substance in the urine and plasma
multiplied by the urine flow rate. The renal clearance of certain substances allows us to
estimate some physiologic parameters. For example, inulin is freely filtered but it is
neither reabsorbed nor secreted, meaning the inulin that is filtered is also cleared.
Therefore, inulin clearance measures the glomerular filtration rate. Para-aminohippuric
acid (PAH) is both filtered and secreted and can be used to estimate renal plasma flow.
Since, volume of RBCs accounts for a significant percentage of blood volume
(hematocrit), the renal blood flow can be estimated from the renal plasma flow as RBF =
RPF / (1 - Hct).
As previously mentioned, the effective renal plasma flow equals the clearance of PAH.
Clearance of any substance is calculated as: [U] * V / [P].
In this case, it is 580 mg/mL * 1 mL/min / 1 mg/mL = 580 mL/min.
The renal blood flow is calculated as: RPF / (1 - Hct) = 580 mL/min / (1 - 0.42) = 1000

The correct answer is d.
Renal clearance is the rate at which a substance is cleared from plasma. It can be
calculated as the ratio of the concentration of the substance in the urine and plasma
multiplied by the urine flow rate. Inulin is freely filtered but neither reabsorbed nor
secreted, meaning the inulin that is filtered is also removed from the body. Therefore,
inulin clearance can be used to measure the glomerular filtration rate. Para-aminohippuric
acid (PAH) is both filtered and secreted and can be used to estimate renal plasma flow.
Since the volume of RBCs accounts for a significant percentage of blood volume
(hematocrit), the renal blood flow can be estimated from the renal plasma flow as RBF =
RPF / (1 - Hct). The RPF is the clearance of PAH, or [U] * V / [P] = 620 mg/mL * 1
mL/min / 1 mg/mL = 620 mL/min. It follows that RBF = 620 mL/min * (1 - 0.45) = 620

The correct answer is a.
Renal clearance is the rate at which a substance is cleared from plasma. We can calculate
it by multiplying the ratio of concentrations of the substance in the urine and plasma by
the urine flow rate. Inulin is freely filtered but it is neither reabsorbed nor secreted so all
the inulin that is filtered is also cleared, making inulin clearance an excellent marker for
glomerular filtration rate. Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) is both filtered and secreted
and can be used to estimate renal plasma flow. RBCs account for a significant percentage
of blood volume (hematocrit), so the renal blood flow can be estimated from the renal
plasma flow as RBF = RPF / (1 - Hct).
The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the clearance of inulin. It is calculated as [U] * V /
[P] = 150 mg/mL * 1 mL/min / 1 mg/mL = 150 mL/min. The clearance of PAH
represents the effective renal plasma flow and in this patient equals 610 mg/mL * 1
mL/min / 1 mg/mL = 610 mL/min. The effective renal blood flow is calculated as RBF =

The correct answer is b.
Renal clearance represents the rate at which a substance is cleared from plasma. It can be
calculated as the ratio of the concentrations of the substance in the urine and plasma
multiplied by the urine flow rate. Inulin, as a substance that is only filtered (and neither
reabsorbed nor secreted) is an excellent marker for glomerular filtration rate while PAH
(a substance that is filtered and secreted) is an excellent marker for renal blood flow. The
volume of RBCs accounts for a significant percentage of blood volume (hematocrit) so
the renal blood flow can be estimated from the renal plasma flow as RBF = RPF / (1 Hct). The filtration fraction represents the proportion of the renal plasma flow that is
filtered in the glomerulus (GFR/RPF).
The filtration fraction is calculated as: FF = GFR/RPF = Clearance (inulin) / Clearance
(PAH).
The clearance of inulin is: C (inulin) = [U] * V / [P] = 140 mL/min.
The clearance of PAH is: C (PAH) = [U] * V / [P] = 600 mL/min.
The filtration fraction is: FF = 140 mL/min / 600 mL/min = 23%.

flow.

HCO3- 12 mEq/L. Which of the following best describes the acid-base status in this

b) metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis
c) metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis
d) metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation
e) metabolic alkalosis with respiratory alkalosis

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 46

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is c.
This patient is most likely suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis, a form of metabolic
acidosis. Healthy individuals generally respond to acid-base disturbances by
compensating for them. Metabolic compensation occurs with respiratory
acidosis/alkalosis and respiratory compensation occurs with metabolic acidosis/alkalosis.
It is possible to calculate the expected compensation for each patient. If the measured
values do not correspond to the calculated expected values, a combined disorder should
be suspected.
Winter’s formula is used to evaluate respiratory compensation in metabolic acidosis:
PaCO2 = (1.5 * HCO3-) + 8 +/- 2.
In this case PaCO2 = 1.5 * 12 + 8 +/- 2 = 26 +/-2.
Since the actual PaCO2 in this patient is higher than what would be expected in a
compensated metabolic acidosis, the patient has likely developed respiratory acidosis on
top of the metabolic alkalosis, likely due to respiratory failure.
If the PaCO2 level was lower than what would be expected according to Winter’s
formula, the likely explanation would be a concurrent respiratory alkalosis.

The correct answer is a.
Anion gap is the difference between the measured cations and anions in the plasma. In
reality, in order for plasma to be electrically neutral, the number of cations and anions
must be equal. However, fewer anions are measured compared to cations. Even if we
exclude potassium from the equation, the concentration of sodium cation is still larger
than the sum of the concentrations of chlorine and bicarbonate anions, accounting for the

can be caused by the addition of new anions from different acids (e.g., in ketoacidosis or
lactic acidosis). In those cases, the bicarbonate anions are “replaced” by unmeasured
anions and the anion gap widens. In some other cases, where no new anions are added,
the bicarbonate anions are replaced by chlorine, which is measured so the anion gap
remains unchanged. This is why metabolic acidosis in general can be divided into normal

The correct answer is c.
Anion gap is the difference between the measured cations and anions in the plasma. In
reality, in order for plasma to be electrically neutral, the number of cations and anions
must be equal. However, fewer anions are measured compared to cations. Even if we
exclude potassium from the equation, the concentration of sodium cation is still larger
than the sum of the concentrations of chlorine and bicarbonate anions, accounting for the
“gap”. The normal anion gap is between 6 and 12 mEq/L. Sometimes, metabolic acidosis
can be caused by the addition of new anions from different acids (e.g., in ketoacidosis or
lactic acidosis). In those cases, the bicarbonate anions are “replaced” by unmeasured

e) 40 mEq/L

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 54

The correct answer is b.
This patient is suffering from acidosis. Diarrhea is a cause of normal anion gap metabolic
acidosis. Anion gap represents the difference between the measured cations and the
measured anions in the plasma. To preserve electroneutrality, the real concentrations of
anions and cations must be equal. However, fewer anions are measured compared to
cations, leading to the “gap”. The normal anion gap is between 6 and 12 mEq/L.
Metabolic acidosis can be caused by the addition of new anions from different acids (e.g.,
in ketoacidosis or lactic acidosis), which are themselves unmeasured, widening the gap.
There are also cases of metabolic acidosis where no new anions are added and the
bicarbonate anions are replaced by chlorine, which is measured so the anion gap remains
unchanged.
The causes of high anion gap metabolic acidosis can be memorized using the mnemonic

of the following represents the alveolar PO2 in this patient:

b) 114 mmHg
c) 86 mmHg
d) 91 mmHg
e) cannot be calculated

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 56

The correct answer is a.
In order to calculate the alveolar PO2 in this patient, we need to use the alveolar gas
equation:
PAO2 = PIO2 - PaCO2 / R.
R is the respiratory quotient (the respiratory exchange ratio), in this case it is 0.8 (since
CO2 production is 80% of oxygen consumption). PIO2 in this case is 150 mmHg. PaCO2
is 36 mmHg.
PAO2 = 150 mmHg - 36 mmHg / 0.8 = 150 mmHg - 45 = 105 mmHg.

28. A clinical study is done at the pulmonology department to compare lung function
between individuals of different ages. The researchers decide to compare the physiologic
dead spaces between individuals. If all the other variables were the same, which of the
following would be associated with an increase in physiologic dead space:
a) increased PECO2
b) increased VT
c) decreased PaCO2
d) decreased minute ventilation
e) increased respiratory rate

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 58

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is b.
Dead space refers to the volume of the airways that does not participate in gas exchange.
Anatomic dead space refers to the volume of the conducting airways, whereas
physiologic dead space refers to the volume of lungs that does not participate in gas
exchange, usually due to a ventilation/perfusion mismatch.
Physiologic dead space can be calculated from the following equation:
VD = VT * [(PaCO2 - PECO2) / PaCO2], where VD is the physiologic dead space, VT is
the tidal volume, PaCO2 is the PCO2 of the arterial blood and PECO2 is the PCO2 of
mixed expired air.
From this equation, it can be concluded that an increase in VT would lead to elevated
VD, assuming PaCO2 and PECO2 remained the same. If PaCO2 and PECO2 were equal,
VD would be 0. The minute ventilation is TV * breaths/minute.

the following is the physiologic dead space volume in this patient:

b) 50 mL
c) 125 mL
d) 150 mL
e) 333 mL

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 60

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is c.
Dead space is the volume of the airways that does not participate in gas exchange and can
be divided into anatomic and physiologic dead space. Anatomic dead space is the volume
of the conducting airways (which do not take part in gas exchange). Physiologic dead
space is to the volume of lungs that does not participate in gas exchange (i.e., due to
ventilation-perfusion mismatch).
The physiologic dead space can be calculated from the following equation (think of it as
if trying to determine how much of the alveolar oxygen is not used to “generate” CO2):
VD = VT * [(PaCO2 - PECO2) / PaCO2], where VD is the physiologic dead space, VT is
the tidal volume, PaCO2 is the PCO2 of the arterial blood and PECO2 is the PCO2 of
mixed expired air.
VD = 500 mL * [(40 mmHg - 30 mmHg) / 40 mmHg] = 500 mL * 0.25 = 125 mL.
The respiratory rate is needed to calculate the alveolar ventilation:
VA = (VT - VD) * breaths/min.
If PaCO2 and PECO2 were equal, VD would be 0. The minute ventilation is TV *
breaths/minute.

a) increased CO and unchanged pressure difference
b) increased CO and increased pressure difference
c) increased CO and decreased pressure difference
d) decreased CO and decreased pressure difference
e) decreased CO and increased pressure difference

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 62

The correct answer is e.
Just like in any other organ, the same principle for calculating the vascular resistance
applies in the lungs as well. Remember that pressure difference = resistance * flow. The
flow represents the cardiac output as the entire cardiac output and resistance is the
pulmonary vascular resistance.
Pulmonary vascular resistance can, therefore, be calculated from the following equation:
PVR = ( P pulm art. - P left atrium) / Cardiac Output.
Decreased CO and increased pressure difference would, therefore, lead to an increase in
PVR.

a) 42 mg
b) 168 mg
c) 200 mg
d) 210 mg
e) 280 mg

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 68

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is b.
In order to answer this question, we need to determine the loading dose of the drug. The
loading dose is the initial higher dose of the drug given to achieve a certain plasma
concentration earlier before maintaining it with a lower, maintenance dose. It is
calculated from the following equation: LD = ( Cp * Vd ) / F, where Cp is the plasma
level, Vd is the volume of distribution, and F is the bioavailability of the drug. The
loading dose is proportional to the volume of distribution because the larger the volume
of distribution the more drug needs to be given to achieve the same plasma concentration.
The bioavailability of the drug is the opposite. More drug needs to be given if the
bioavailability is lower (i.e., drugs with low bioavailability less readily enter systemic
circulation so more drug needs to be given). For drugs administered intravenously, F = 1.
Since the drug is distributed in total body water, Vd is about 60% of total body weight, or
42 kg (0.6 * 70 kg). 42 kg of water is 42 L of water. Therefore, Vd = 42 L.
LD = 4 mg/L * 42 L / 1 = 168 mg.

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 70

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is c.
The answer to this question can be calculated from the equation for the loading dose of
the drug. The loading dose is the initial higher dose of the drug given to achieve a certain
plasma concentration earlier before reducing the dosage to a maintenance dose. The
loading dose is calculated as: LD = ( Cp * Vd ) / F, where Cp is the plasma level, Vd is
the volume of distribution, and F is the bioavailability of the drug. The greater the volume
of distribution of the drug, the more drug needs to be given to achieve the same plasma
concentration, whereas more drug needs to be given if the bioavailability is lower. For
drugs administered intravenously, F = 1 as all the drug enters systemic circulation. Since
the drug is distributed in total body water, Vd is about 60% of total body weight, or 0.6 *
75 kg = 45 kg. 45 kg of water is 45 L of water. Loading dose is 1,800 mg.
1,800 mg = Cp * 45 L / 1 => Cp * 45 L = 1,800 mg => Cp = 1,800 mg / 45 L = 40 mg/L.

b) Vd would decrease
c) loading dose would increase
d) clearance of the drug would increase
e) maintenance dose would be lower

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 72

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is e.
The patient in question has decreased renal function, meaning his renal clearance is
lower. The maintenance dose of the drug is the dose of drug given to the patient to
maintain a certain plasma concentration. The equation for the maintenance dose is: MD =
Cl * Cp * td / F, where Cl is the clearance, Cp is the steady state concentration, td is the
dosing interval and F is the bioavailability. It can be concluded from this equation that the
maintenance dose would be lower if the renal clearance was lower. It also makes sense
intuitively as a decrease in renal clearance of the drug indicates that more drug remains in
the body for extended periods of time so lower maintenance doses would be needed to
maintain a certain plasma concentration. Vd would not change. t 1/2 would increase due
to decreased clearance. Note that the loading dose equation, in comparison, does not take
into account the renal clearance.

d) 640 mg
e) 800 mg

The correct answer is b.
Once a drug enters the body, it distributes within body fluid compartments. Not all drugs
distribute equally (i.e., some may remain in plasma only, others may distribute in
interstitial fluid, while some others may distribute in total body water). The volume of
distribution is the ratio of the total amount of drug in the body and the concentration of
the drug (remember, for any solution c = amount / V => V = amount / c). Therefore, Vd =
amount of drug in the body / Cp => amount of drug in the body = Vd * Cp. Since water
represents approximately 60% of body weight, it can be calculated that this patient has 48
kg of water in his body (0.6 * 80 kg), or 48 L of water. Therefore, Vd is 48 L. Cp = 10

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 78

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is e.
Individual drugs distribute differently between the body’s fluid compartments. The
volume of distribution represents to what degree the drug distributes within the body and
can be calculated as the ratio of the total amount of drug in the body and the
concentration of the drug (remember, for any solution c = amount / V => V = amount / c).
Therefore, the volume of distribution of a drug can be calculated from the following
formula:
Vd = amount of drug in the body / Cp.
In this patient, Vd = 600 mg / 10 mg/L = 60 L.
Since the drug is distributed in the total body water, the total volume of water in this
patient is 60 L. The weight of 60 L of water is 60 kg. Since water represents
approximately 60% of body weight, it can be calculated that his body weight is 60 kg /

d) 7.50 L/h

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM 80

MEHLMANMEDICAL.COM

The correct answer is c.
First-order elimination of the drug means that a constant fraction of the drug is eliminated

frame in which the concentration of the drug in the body halves. The equation used to
calculate the half-life of the drug is:
t 1/2 = 0.7 * Vd / Cl.
It makes sense that clearance is inversely proportional to the half-life (i.e., greater
clearance means more drug is removed from the body, making the half-life shorter).
The clearance of the drug can be calculated from the equation for the half-life:
t 1/2 = 0.7 * Vd / Cl => Cl = 0.7 * Vd / t 1/2 = 0.7 * 30 L / 4 h = 5.25 L/h.

The half-life is calculated for the drugs that follow first-order kinetics, meaning that a

which the concentration of the drug in the body halves.
The equation used to calculate the half-life of the drug is:
t 1/2 = 0.7 * Vd / Cl.
Since the drug is distributed in total body water, Vd is the total volume of water in the

The correct answer is b.
The rate of elimination can be calculated from the following equation:
Cl = rate of elimination / Cp => rate of elimination = Cl * Cp; where Cl is clearance and
Cp is plasma concentration.
The rate of elimination of the drug is proportional to the clearance and the concentration
of the drug (the more drug in the plasma and the higher the clearance of such plasma - the
more drug gets eliminated).
First-order elimination of the drug means that a constant fraction of the drug is eliminated
per unit of time, making it possible to determine the half-life of the drug, which is the
time frame in which the concentration of the drug in the body reduces by 50%.
The equation used to calculate the half-life of the drug is:
t 1/2 = 0.7 * Vd / Cl, where t 1/2 is the half-life and Vd volume of distribution.
Clearance of the drug can be calculated from that equation:
t 1/2 = 0.7 * Vd / Cl => Cl = 0.7 * Vd / t 1/2.
The drug is distributed in total body water, which accounts for 60% of the body weight,
or 48 kg (0.8 * 80 kg). 48 kg of water have the volume of 48 L. Therefore, Vd = 48 L.

The correct answer is a.
Salicylate intoxication in adults usually occurs following intentional overdose with
aspirin. It causes respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis simultaneously, resulting in
a mixed acid-base disorder. The respiratory alkalosis is caused by the stimulation of the
respiratory center and occurs shortly after ingestion. Respiratory stimulation leads to
increased expiration of CO2 and subsequent alkalosis development. A few hours later, a
number of metabolic derangements develop, including the uncoupling of oxidative
phosphorylation, leading to acid accumulation (increase in unmeasured anions) and
subsequent high anion gap metabolic acidosis development. Patients who present soon
after the ingestion will generally have respiratory alkalosis alone, while those who present
a few hours later will typically have a mixed disorder (respiratory alkalosis with
metabolic acidosis). Winter’s formula is used to evaluate respiratory compensation in
metabolic acidosis. PaCO2 = (1.5 * HCO3-) + 8 +/- 2. If the value is outside of the range
predicted by Winter’s formula, a mixed disorder should be suspected. In this case, a
patient has a combined metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. Therefore, PaCO2
level in this patient would be lower than expected according to the Winter’s formula.
PaCO2 = 1.5 * 8 + 8 +/- 2 = 12 + 8 +/- 2 = 20 +/- 2.
In a patient with compensated metabolic acidosis, the expected PaCO2 would be between
18 and 22 mmHg. Patients who also have a respiratory alkalosis would have PaCO2
levels lower than 18 mmHg.
