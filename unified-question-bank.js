US federal requirements for children involved in research state that both parents must give consent when at all possible, in addition to the patient who is the minor. One parent may give consent if the second parent is unavailable or deceased. It is never appropriate to enroll a minor in a research study without parental consent.",

    "explanation": "Cohort studies always move in the direction of risk factor \u2192 disease. That is: Group with risk factor vs Group without risk factor \u2192 did they develop the disease. Case-control studies are the opposite. They move in the direction of disease \u2192 risk factor. This is a retrospective cohort study because researchers are looking back through medical records of those who had a risk factor (IV drug use) vs no risk factor and seeing whether they developed the disease (myxoma).",

    "correctAnswerIndex": 2,
    "explanation": "Minors have the right to confidentiality without parental consent for sexual health,\nobstetric/gynecologic care, drug-use, and/or mental health management.\nIn this case, the minor has a right to have her sexual activity withheld from her parents. Breaching\nthis confidentiality jeopardizes non-maleficence \u2013 i.e., it does harm if she believes there will be\npunative measures against her if her mom knows. The result is she may not seek continued care\nwith the physician, or may learn to distrust doctors in general, putting her at greater risk for\nproblems going forward.\nEven though sexual activity is one of the greatest risk factors for UTIs, the latter in and of\nthemselves do not fall under the envelope of conditions that can be withheld from parents. This\nchild needs antibiotics for her UTI. The consent of her mom is required. This needs to be\ncommunicated to the minor.\nIf the minor is emancipated, then no parental consent is required, even for UTI management.\nEmancipated minors are those who are not dependent on their parents for everyday life and are\ntherefore eligible to make healthcare decisions without parental consent. This refers to minors who\nare in the military, living independently (e.g., a high-school graduate with a full-time job who lives\naway from home), or who have children of their own whom they support.

    "explanation": "Offering to have a female member of staff sit in during the consult is one effective way to make\nparents feel more comfortable leaving their children alone with a physician.\nIf the mother ultimately refuses to allow her daughter be left alone with the physician, this must be\nrespected, but also documented. However offering to have a female member of staff sit in during\nthe consult is a solution that should first be attempted.\nIf the physician suspects child abuse, he or she must contact child protective services, but this is\nnot advised in a setting where abuse is not specifically suspected.\nChoice A is dismissive of the parent\u2019s refusal.\nChoice B is a reiteration of what the physician already attempted prior to the parent\u2019s refusal.",

If the parent refuses, offering for a female member of staff to sit in is\nsometimes effective. If the parent refuses again, his or her wishes must be respected, followed by\nproper documentation by the physician. If the physician does not suspect abuse, there is no need\nfor reporting.

    "explanation": "Eligibility for hospice care necessitates terminal illness with a prognosis of <6 months of life\nremaining. The patient must also not be pursuing, or interested in pursuing, any type of lifeextending management.\nThe stage of pancreatic cancer cancer is irrelevant. If the patient had Stage 1 cancer and a 4-month\nprognosis, he would be eligible for hospice care insofar as he is not interested in pursuing lifeextending measures.\nTypes of management that make a patient ineligible for hospice care include any type of chemo- or\nradiotherapy, as these extend life.\nSounds highly specific and weird, but USMLE 2CK wants you to be aware that thoracentesis is an\nacceptable management to be received by those in hospice care. The implication is that those with,\ne.g., malignant pleural effusions, may receive thoracentesis to improve symptoms, but the\nmanagement in and of itself does not extend life.",

    "explanation": "Patients who are receiving hospice care are free to leave at any point if they wish to pursue more\naggressive management of their condition. The requirements for hospice admission are terminal\nillness with prognosis of < 6 months and no pursuit of life-extending treatments.\nChoice A is werong because the patient is free to resume hospice care if he wishes to terminate his\nprescription of the new drug. While patients are allowed to take medication while in hospice, this\nnew drug may improve prognosis and therefore is considered life-extending, meaning it cannot be\ntaken while in hospice care.\nThe aims of palliative care are to optimize quality of life and mitigate suffering in patients who\nmay have >6 months of life remaining and who may be seeking life-extending management.\nPalliative care happens in hospital. Hospice care occurs wherever the patient calls home.\nPalliative care may be paid by insurance or self-pay. Hospice care is covered by Medicaid,\nMedicare, or insurance.\nBottom line: Patients in hospice who wish to pursue life-extending management may be\ntransferred to palliative care.",

    "explanation": "Physicians are not required to provide futile care when there is no prospect of the patient\nrecovering. In this case, the patient is brain-dead and further treatment would not change his\nprognosis.\nEEG and MR angiography can be considered in uncertain cases but are not required to diagnose\nbrain-death in this patient.\nAbsence of brainstem reflexes and apnea test prove brain-death. Coma and brain-death should not\nbe confused. Treating a brain-dead patient is futile, while treating a comatose patient is not.\nThe hospital ethics committee can be consulted when there are differences in opinion between\nfamily members regarding what an incapacitated patient might want in terms of care.\nTransfer of care to another physician is the answer on the USMLE if a patient wishes to\ndiscontinue life support but the physician wishes not to do it. This is on the NBME exams. The\nimplication is that care will be discontinued as per the patient\u2019s autonomy and wishes, but the\nphysician who is strongly opposed to the discontinuation distances him or herself from the\ndecision for emotional reasons.

It is never okay to allow patients to suffer from pain.\nIt should be noted, in contrast, that physician-assisted suicide (e.g., prescribing high doses of\nbenzodiazepines to a patient who wants to end his or her life) and euthanasia (intentionally ending\na patient\u2019s life, unrelated to pain management) are illegal in most of the United States.

If the patient becomes incapacitated, the durable power of attorney equals the patient for\nall intents and purposes, surpassing in priority any verbal wishes the patient may have made prior\nto incapacitation, as well as the patient\u2019s living will.\nIn other words, the durable power of attorney can make all personal and legal decisions on behalf\nof the patient if he or she becomes incapacitated.\nThere are four main types of Power of Attorney:\nGeneral power of attorney: the designated individual can perform most acts as the principal,\nincluding managing finances and opening accounts. The general power of attorney arrangement is\nterminated if the patient becomes incapacitated.\nDurable power of attorney: the designated individual can act on the principal\u2019s behalf and\nincludes a durable clause that maintains this power even if the patient becomes incapacitated.\nSpringing durable power of attorney: the designated individual becomes the durable power of\nattorney only when the patient becomes incapacitated. Prior to incapacitation, the designated\nindividual does not act as a power of attorney for the patient.\nSpecial or limited power of attorney: the designated individual has power limited to a specific\narea, such as selling the property of the patient.\nBottom line: A durable power of attorney overrides the living will (advanced directive) in the\nsetting of patient incapacitation, even if the patient specified wishes to the contrary immediately\nprior to incapacitation.",

    "explanation": "A simple open-ended question assessing the patient\u2019s feelings about entering hospital is most\nappropriate. This exact same type of statement is also used if needing to involuntarily hospitalize a\npatient for, e.g., suicidality.\nIV acyclovir is the answer on USMLE for herpes zoster if the patient is immunocompromised,\nundergoing chemotherapy, or is toxic (i.e., high fever, chills). If the patient merely has diabetes\nmellitus, orals can be given without the need for admission to hospital (on NBME).\nChoice A is wrong because this would be violating non-maleficence \u2013 i.e., we would be doing\nharm to the patient if not at least offering the management we best see fit.\nChoice C is wrong because this represents mismanagement of where the patient needs to be\ntreated. It might seem that this patient could be harmlessly managed in outpatient emergency, but\nif a true crisis were to arise and maximal staff resources were needed elsewhere, that would be\ndoing a disservice to this patient. Patients should be accommodated in every way possible, but this\ndoes not mean improper triage or location of care.\nChoice D is a good, direct statement. But it is not as ideal as B because it is not an open-ended\nquestion. Choice D might be appropriate if the patient responds to B by saying she does not want\nto be in hospital. Now the physician needs to directly communicate his thoughts about admitting\nher.\nChoice E suggests an involuntary hospitalization is ensuing. This would be an acceptable answer\nafter choice B if the patient needed to be admitted for, e.g., suicidality.",

If the remedies are otherwise harmless, the physician should\ndiscuss how the remedy and necessary treatment can be worked in together.

Elevated\nhydrostatic pressure in the capillary and elevated oncotic pressure in the interstitium favor\nthe movement of fluid out of the capillaries, while elevated oncotic pressure in the\ncapillaries and elevated hydrostatic pressure in the interstitium favor the opposite. Fluid\nmoves from the area of the higher hydrostatic pressure towards the area with the lower\nhydrostatic pressure and from the area of lower oncotic pressure to the area of higher\noncotic pressure. Also, by looking at the formula, we can see that increasing the capillary\nhydrostatic pressure and decreasing the capillary oncotic pressure are the changes that\nwould lead to edema formation.
