# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## üöÄ Step-by-Step GitHub Pages Setup

Your project is now ready for GitHub Pages deployment! Follow these steps to get your USMLE Review Tool live on the web.

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**

### Step 2: Repository Configuration

**Repository Settings:**
- **Repository name**: `usmle-review-tool` (or any name you prefer)
- **Description**: `USMLE Step 1 Review Tool - Progressive Web App for medical exam preparation`
- **Visibility**: Choose **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
- **Initialize**: Leave unchecked (we already have files)

**Click "Create repository"**

### Step 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Copy the commands GitHub shows you after creating the repository, or use these with your repository URL:

```bash
# Set your remote repository (replace with your actual GitHub URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/usmle-review-tool.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub.com
2. **Click the "Settings" tab** (far right in the repository navigation)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. **Under "Source"**, select **"Deploy from a branch"**
5. **Choose branch**: **main**
6. **Choose folder**: **/ (root)**
7. **Click "Save"**

### Step 5: Access Your Live App

After 5-10 minutes, your app will be live at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/usmle-review-tool
```

GitHub will show you the exact URL in the Pages settings.

To update your app after deployment:

## üìä Analytics Setup (Optional)

Add Google Analytics to track usage:

1. **Create Google Analytics account**
2. **Get your tracking ID**
3. **Add tracking code** to `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Add before closing </head> tag -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
